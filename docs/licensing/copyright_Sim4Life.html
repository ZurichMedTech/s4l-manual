Customer shall within ten (10) days from receipt examine the Tangible Medium and immediately give notice to ZMT of any defects. ZMT will replace such defective Tangible Medium. This clause 11.4 also applies to the replacement Tangible Medium.
<br />
11.5    Furthermore, the warranty is voided in full if any dysfunction results from misapplication, utilisation of an improper hardware or software environment, unauthorised maintenance or by any breach of this Agreement.
<br />
11.6    Nothing set forth in this Agreement with respect to Support Services shall be construed as expanding or adding to the warranty otherwise provided in this Agreement.
<br />
11.7    ZMT does not provide any warranty other than expressly set forth in this clause 11.
<br />
<br /><br />
12. Liability

<br />
<br /><br />
13. Confidentiality
<br />

<br />
13.2    Customer may give access to Confidential Information only to its employees and students and only on a need-to-know basis. Customer shall use all due care to keep Confidential Information confidential.

14.3    If any sum due to ZMT or any of its representatives or distributors under this Agreement should become overdue, ZMT may, without declaring Customer to be in default, charge Customer default interest of 8.5 per cent per annum on the overdue amount.
<br />
<br /><br />
15. Termination
<br />
15.1    This Agreement and all Licences granted hereunder may be terminated with immediate effect:
<br />
15.1.1  by ZMT if Customer fails to pay any sums due under this Agreement for more than thirty (30) days after such sum becomes due and payable, provided that ZMT has once reminded Customer of the default;

   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION
<br />
<br /><br />
   1. Definitions.
<br />
<br /><br />
      "License" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,
<br />
      and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.
<br />
<br /><br />
      "Licensor" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by
<br />
      the copyright owner that is granting the License.
<br />
<br /><br />
      "Legal Entity" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all
<br />
      other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
<br />
      control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,
<br />
      "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
<br />
      direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
<br />
      otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
<br />
      outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.
<br />
<br /><br />
      "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
<br />
      exercising permissions granted by this License.
<br />
<br /><br />
      "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
<br />
      including but not limited to software source code, documentation
<br />
      source, and configuration files.
<br />
<br /><br />
      "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
<br />
      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
<br />
      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
<br />
      and conversions to other media types.
<br />
<br /><br />
      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
<br />
      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
<br />
      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
<br />
      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).
<br />
<br /><br />
      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
<br />
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
<br />
      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
<br />
      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
<br />
      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
<br />
      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
<br />
      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
<br />
<br /><br />
      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
<br />
      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
<br />
      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
<br />
      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
<br />
      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
<br />
      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
<br />
      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
<br />
      to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
<br />
      communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
<br />
      and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
<br />
      Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
<br />
      excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
<br />
      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."
<br />
<br /><br />
      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
<br />
      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
<br />
      subsequently incorporated within the Work.
<br />
<br /><br />
   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
<br />
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
<br />
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
<br />
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
<br />
      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
<br />
      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
<br />
<br /><br />
   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
<br />
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
<br />
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
<br />
      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
<br />
      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
<br />
      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
<br />
      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
<br />
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
<br />
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
<br />
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
<br />
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
<br />
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
<br />
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
<br />
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
<br />
      as of the date such litigation is filed.
<br />
<br /><br />
   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
<br />
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
<br />
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
<br />
      meet the following conditions:
<br />
<br /><br />
      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
<br />
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
<br />
<br /><br />
      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
<br />
          stating that You changed the files; and
<br />
<br /><br />
      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
<br />
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
<br />
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
<br />
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
<br />
          the Derivative Works; and
<br />
<br /><br />
      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
<br />
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
<br />
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
<br />
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
<br />
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
<br />
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
<br />
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
<br />
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
<br />
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
<br />
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
<br />
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
<br />
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
<br />
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
<br />
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
<br />
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
<br />
          as modifying the License.
<br />
<br /><br />
      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
<br />
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
<br />
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
<br />
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
<br />
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
<br />
      the conditions stated in this License.
<br />
<br /><br />
   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
<br />
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
<br />
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
<br />
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
<br />
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
<br />
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
<br />
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
<br />
<br /><br />
   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
<br />
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
<br />
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
<br />
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
<br />
<br /><br />
   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
<br />
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
<br />
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
<br />
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
<br />
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
<br />
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
<br />
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
<br />
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
<br />
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
<br />
<br /><br />
   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
<br />
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
<br />
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
<br />
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
<br />
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
<br />
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
<br />
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
<br />
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
<br />
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
<br />
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
<br />
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
<br />
<br /><br />
   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
<br />
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
<br />
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
<br />
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
<br />
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
<br />
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
<br />
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
<br />
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
<br />
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
<br />
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
<br />
<br /><br />
   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
<br />
Version 3, 29 June 2007
<br />
<br /><br />
Copyright © 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <https://fsf.org/>
<br />
<br /><br />
Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
<br />
<br /><br />
This version of the GNU Lesser General Public License incorporates the terms and conditions of version 3 of the GNU General Public License, supplemented by the additional permissions listed below.
<br />
<br /><br />
0. Additional Definitions.
<br />
As used herein, "this License" refers to version 3 of the GNU Lesser General Public License, and the "GNU GPL" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.
<br />
<br /><br />
"The Library" refers to a covered work governed by this License, other than an Application or a Combined Work as defined below.
<br />
<br /><br />
An "Application" is any work that makes use of an interface provided by the Library, but which is not otherwise based on the Library. Defining a subclass of a class defined by the Library is deemed a mode of using an interface provided by the Library.
<br />
<br /><br />
A "Combined Work" is a work produced by combining or linking an Application with the Library. The particular version of the Library with which the Combined Work was made is also called the "Linked Version".
<br />
<br /><br />
The "Minimal Corresponding Source" for a Combined Work means the Corresponding Source for the Combined Work, excluding any source code for portions of the Combined Work that, considered in isolation, are based on the Application, and not on the Linked Version.
<br />
<br /><br />
The "Corresponding Application Code" for a Combined Work means the object code and/or source code for the Application, including any data and utility programs needed for reproducing the Combined Work from the Application, but excluding the System Libraries of the Combined Work.
<br />
<br /><br />
1. Exception to Section 3 of the GNU GPL.
<br />
You may convey a covered work under sections 3 and 4 of this License without being bound by section 3 of the GNU GPL.
<br />
<br /><br />
2. Conveying Modified Versions.
<br />
If you modify a copy of the Library, and, in your modifications, a facility refers to a function or data to be supplied by an Application that uses the facility (other than as an argument passed when the facility is invoked), then you may convey a copy of the modified version:
<br />
<br /><br />
a) under this License, provided that you make a good faith effort to ensure that, in the event an Application does not supply the function or data, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful, or
<br />
b) under the GNU GPL, with none of the additional permissions of this License applicable to that copy.
<br />
3. Object Code Incorporating Material from Library Header Files.
<br />
The object code form of an Application may incorporate material from a header file that is part of the Library. You may convey such object code under terms of your choice, provided that, if the incorporated material is not limited to numerical parameters, data structure layouts and accessors, or small macros, inline functions and templates (ten or fewer lines in length), you do both of the following:
<br />
<br /><br />
a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the object code that the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by this License.
<br />
b) Accompany the object code with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license document.
<br />
4. Combined Works.
<br />
You may convey a Combined Work under terms of your choice that, taken together, effectively do not restrict modification of the portions of the Library contained in the Combined Work and reverse engineering for debugging such modifications, if you also do each of the following:
<br />
<br /><br />
a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the Combined Work that the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by this License.
<br />
b) Accompany the Combined Work with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license document.
<br />
c) For a Combined Work that displays copyright notices during execution, include the copyright notice for the Library among these notices, as well as a reference directing the user to the copies of the GNU GPL and this license document.
<br />
d) Do one of the following:
<br />
0) Convey the Minimal Corresponding Source under the terms of this License, and the Corresponding Application Code in a form suitable for, and under terms that permit, the user to recombine or relink the Application with a modified version of the Linked Version to produce a modified Combined Work, in the manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying Corresponding Source.
<br />
1) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the Library. A suitable mechanism is one that (a) uses at run time a copy of the Library already present on the user's computer system, and (b) will operate properly with a modified version of the Library that is interface-compatible with the Linked Version.
<br />
e) Provide Installation Information, but only if you would otherwise be required to provide such information under section 6 of the GNU GPL, and only to the extent that such information is necessary to install and execute a modified version of the Combined Work produced by recombining or relinking the Application with a modified version of the Linked Version. (If you use option 4d0, the Installation Information must accompany the Minimal Corresponding Source and Corresponding Application Code. If you use option 4d1, you must provide the Installation Information in the manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying Corresponding Source.)
<br />
5. Combined Libraries.
<br />
You may place library facilities that are a work based on the Library side by side in a single library together with other library facilities that are not Applications and are not covered by this License, and convey such a combined library under terms of your choice, if you do both of the following:
<br />
<br /><br />
a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based on the Library, uncombined with any other library facilities, conveyed under the terms of this License.
<br />
b) Give prominent notice with the combined library that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.
<br />
6. Revised Versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License.
<br />
The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.
<br />
<br /><br />
Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Library as you received it specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU Lesser General Public License "or any later version" applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that published version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Library as you received it does not specify a version number of the GNU Lesser General Public License, you may choose any version of the GNU Lesser General Public License ever published by the Free Software Foundation.
<br />
<br /><br />
If the Library as you received it specifies that a proxy can decide whether future versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License shall apply, that proxy's public statement of acceptance of any version is permanent authorization for you to choose that version for the Library.<br />

<br />
* Corporation ("NVIDIA") and governs your use of a NVIDIA
<br />
* software development kit (�SDK�).
<br />
* 
<br />
* Each SDK has its own set of software and materials, but here
<br />
* is a description of the types of items that may be included in
<br />
* a SDK: source code, header files, APIs, data sets and assets
<br />
* (examples include images, textures, models, scenes, videos,
<br />
* native API input/output files), binary software, sample code,
<br />
* libraries, utility programs, programming code and
<br />
* documentation.
<br />
* 
<br />
* This Agreement can be accepted only by an adult of legal age
<br />
* of majority in the country in which the SDK is used.
<br />
* 
<br />
* If you are entering into this Agreement on behalf of a company
<br />
* or other legal entity, you represent that you have the legal
<br />
* authority to bind the entity to this Agreement, in which case
<br />
* �you� will mean the entity you represent.
<br />
* 
<br />
* If you don�t have the required age or authority to accept
<br />
* this Agreement, or if you don�t accept all the terms and
<br />
* conditions of this Agreement, do not download, install or use
<br />
* the SDK.
<br />
* 
<br />
* You agree to use the SDK only for purposes that are permitted
<br />
* by (a) this Agreement, and (b) any applicable law, regulation
<br />
* or generally accepted practices or guidelines in the relevant
<br />
* jurisdictions.
<br />

<br />
* 
<br />
* 
<br />
* 1.1.1. License Grant
<br />
* 
<br />
* Subject to the terms of this Agreement, NVIDIA hereby grants
<br />
* you a non-exclusive, non-transferable license, without the
<br />
* right to sublicense (except as expressly provided in this
<br />
* Agreement) to:
<br />
* 
<br />
*   1. Install and use the SDK,
<br />
* 
<br />
*   2. Modify and create derivative works of sample source code
<br />
*     delivered in the SDK, and
<br />
* 
<br />
*   3. Distribute those portions of the SDK that are identified
<br />
*     in this Agreement as distributable, as incorporated in
<br />
*     object code format into a software application that meets
<br />
*     the distribution requirements indicated in this Agreement.
<br />
* 
<br />
* 
<br />
* 1.1.2. Distribution Requirements
<br />
* 
<br />
* These are the distribution requirements for you to exercise
<br />
* the distribution grant:
<br />
* 
<br />
*   1. Your application must have material additional
<br />
*     functionality, beyond the included portions of the SDK.
<br />
* 
<br />
*   2. The distributable portions of the SDK shall only be
<br />
*     accessed by your application.
<br />
* 
<br />
*   3. The following notice shall be included in modifications
<br />
*     and derivative works of sample source code distributed:
<br />
*     �This software contains source code provided by NVIDIA
<br />
*     Corporation.�
<br />
* 
<br />
*   4. Unless a developer tool is identified in this Agreement
<br />
*     as distributable, it is delivered for your internal use
<br />
*     only.
<br />
* 
<br />
*   5. The terms under which you distribute your application
<br />
*     must be consistent with the terms of this Agreement,
<br />
*     including (without limitation) terms relating to the
<br />
*     license grant and license restrictions and protection of
<br />
*     NVIDIA�s intellectual property rights. Additionally, you
<br />
*     agree that you will protect the privacy, security and
<br />
*     legal rights of your application users.
<br />
* 
<br />
*   6. You agree to notify NVIDIA in writing of any known or
<br />
*     suspected distribution or use of the SDK not in compliance
<br />
*     with the requirements of this Agreement, and to enforce
<br />
*     the terms of your agreements with respect to distributed
<br />
*     SDK.
<br />
* 
<br />
* 
<br />
* 1.1.3. Authorized Users
<br />
* 
<br />
* You may allow employees and contractors of your entity or of
<br />
* your subsidiary(ies) to access and use the SDK from your
<br />
* secure network to perform work on your behalf.
<br />
* 
<br />
* If you are an academic institution you may allow users
<br />
* enrolled or employed by the academic institution to access and
<br />
* use the SDK from your secure network.
<br />
* 
<br />
* You are responsible for the compliance with the terms of this
<br />
* Agreement by your authorized users. If you become aware that
<br />
* your authorized users didn�t follow the terms of this
<br />
* Agreement, you agree to take reasonable steps to resolve the
<br />
* non-compliance and prevent new occurrences.
<br />
* 
<br />
* 
<br />
* 1.1.4. Pre-Release SDK
<br />
* 
<br />
* The SDK versions identified as alpha, beta, preview or
<br />
* otherwise as pre-release, may not be fully functional, may
<br />
* contain errors or design flaws, and may have reduced or
<br />
* different security, privacy, accessibility, availability, and
<br />
* reliability standards relative to commercial versions of
<br />
* NVIDIA software and materials. Use of a pre-release SDK may
<br />
* result in unexpected results, loss of data, project delays or
<br />
* other unpredictable damage or loss.
<br />
* 
<br />
* You may use a pre-release SDK at your own risk, understanding
<br />
* that pre-release SDKs are not intended for use in production
<br />
* or business-critical systems.
<br />
* 
<br />
* NVIDIA may choose not to make available a commercial version
<br />
* of any pre-release SDK. NVIDIA may also choose to abandon
<br />
* development and terminate the availability of a pre-release
<br />
* SDK at any time without liability.
<br />
* 
<br />
* 
<br />
* 1.1.5. Updates
<br />
* 
<br />
* NVIDIA may, at its option, make available patches, workarounds
<br />
* or other updates to this SDK. Unless the updates are provided
<br />
* with their separate governing terms, they are deemed part of
<br />
* the SDK licensed to you as provided in this Agreement. You
<br />
* agree that the form and content of the SDK that NVIDIA
<br />
* provides may change without prior notice to you. While NVIDIA
<br />
* generally maintains compatibility between versions, NVIDIA may
<br />
* in some cases make changes that introduce incompatibilities in
<br />
* future versions of the SDK.
<br />
* 
<br />
* 
<br />
* 1.1.6. Third Party Licenses
<br />
* 
<br />
* The SDK may come bundled with, or otherwise include or be
<br />
* distributed with, third party software licensed by a NVIDIA
<br />
* supplier and/or open source software provided under an open
<br />
* source license. Use of third party software is subject to the
<br />
* third-party license terms, or in the absence of third party
<br />
* terms, the terms of this Agreement. Copyright to third party
<br />
* software is held by the copyright holders indicated in the
<br />
* third-party software or license.
<br />
* 
<br />
* 
<br />
* 1.1.7. Reservation of Rights
<br />
* 
<br />
* NVIDIA reserves all rights, title, and interest in and to the
<br />
* SDK, not expressly granted to you under this Agreement.
<br />
* 
<br />
* 
<br />
* 1.2. Limitations
<br />
* 
<br />
* The following license limitations apply to your use of the
<br />
* SDK:
<br />
* 
<br />
*   1. You may not reverse engineer, decompile or disassemble,
<br />
*     or remove copyright or other proprietary notices from any
<br />
*     portion of the SDK or copies of the SDK.
<br />
* 
<br />
*   2. Except as expressly provided in this Agreement, you may
<br />
*     not copy, sell, rent, sublicense, transfer, distribute,
<br />
*     modify, or create derivative works of any portion of the
<br />
*     SDK. For clarity, you may not distribute or sublicense the
<br />
*     SDK as a stand-alone product.
<br />
* 
<br />
*   3. Unless you have an agreement with NVIDIA for this
<br />
*     purpose, you may not indicate that an application created
<br />
*     with the SDK is sponsored or endorsed by NVIDIA.
<br />
* 
<br />
*   4. You may not bypass, disable, or circumvent any
<br />
*     encryption, security, digital rights management or
<br />
*     authentication mechanism in the SDK.
<br />
* 
<br />
*   5. You may not use the SDK in any manner that would cause it
<br />
*     to become subject to an open source software license. As
<br />
*     examples, licenses that require as a condition of use,
<br />
*     modification, and/or distribution that the SDK be:
<br />
* 
<br />
*       a. Disclosed or distributed in source code form;
<br />
* 
<br />
*       b. Licensed for the purpose of making derivative works;
<br />
*         or
<br />
* 
<br />
*       c. Redistributable at no charge.
<br />
* 
<br />
*   6. Unless you have an agreement with NVIDIA for this
<br />
*     purpose, you may not use the SDK with any system or
<br />
*     application where the use or failure of the system or
<br />
*     application can reasonably be expected to threaten or
<br />
*     result in personal injury, death, or catastrophic loss.
<br />
*     Examples include use in nuclear, avionics, navigation,
<br />
*     military, medical, life support or other life critical
<br />
*     applications. NVIDIA does not design, test or manufacture
<br />
*     the SDK for these critical uses and NVIDIA shall not be
<br />
*     liable to you or any third party, in whole or in part, for
<br />
*     any claims or damages arising from such uses.
<br />
*

<br />
* ITS AFFILIATES EXPRESSLY DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND

* OR NATURE, WHETHER EXPRESS, IMPLIED OR STATUTORY, INCLUDING,
<br />
* BUT NOT LIMITED TO, ANY WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS
<br />
* FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, OR THE

*

* the possibility of such damages, and regardless of whether a
<br />
* remedy fails its essential purpose. These exclusions and
<br />
* limitations of liability form an essential basis of the
<br />
* bargain between the parties, and, absent any of these
<br />
* exclusions or limitations of liability, the provisions of this

<br />
* 
<br />
*       b. (ii) you commence or participate in any legal

<br />
*         continued use of it is no longer commercially viable.
<br />
* 
<br />
*   4. Upon any termination of this Agreement, you agree to
<br />
*     promptly discontinue use of the SDK and destroy all copies

* relief in any jurisdiction.
<br />
*

*     ------------
<br />
*     PCRE is a library of functions to support regular expressions whose syntax
<br />
*     and semantics are as close as possible to those of the Perl 5 language.
<br />
*     Release 8 of PCRE is distributed under the terms of the "BSD" licence, as
<br />
*     specified below. The documentation for PCRE, supplied in the "doc" 
<br />
*     directory, is distributed under the same terms as the software itself. The
<br />
*     basic library functions are written in C and are freestanding. Also 
<br />
*     included in the distribution is a set of C++ wrapper functions, and a just-
<br />
*     in-time compiler that can be used to optimize pattern matching. These are 
<br />
*     both optional features that can be omitted when the library is built.

1. License Agreement for NVIDIA Software Development Kits
<br />
---------------------------------------------------------
<br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Important Notice—Read before downloading, installing,
<br />
copying or using the licensed software:
<br />
-------------------------------------------------------
<br />
<br /><br />
This license agreement, including exhibits attached
<br />
("Agreement") is a legal agreement between you and NVIDIA
<br />
Corporation ("NVIDIA") and governs your use of a NVIDIA
<br />
software development kit ("SDK").
<br />
<br /><br />
Each SDK has its own set of software and materials, but here
<br />
is a description of the types of items that may be included in
<br />
a SDK: source code, header files, APIs, data sets and assets
<br />
(examples include images, textures, models, scenes, videos,
<br />
native API input/output files), binary software, sample code,
<br />
libraries, utility programs, programming code and
<br />
documentation.
<br />
<br /><br />
This Agreement can be accepted only by an adult of legal age
<br />
of majority in the country in which the SDK is used.
<br />
<br /><br />
If you are entering into this Agreement on behalf of a company
<br />
or other legal entity, you represent that you have the legal
<br />
authority to bind the entity to this Agreement, in which case
<br />
"you" will mean the entity you represent.
<br />
<br /><br />
If you don’t have the required age or authority to accept
<br />
this Agreement, or if you don’t accept all the terms and
<br />
conditions of this Agreement, do not download, install or use
<br />
the SDK.
<br />
<br /><br />
You agree to use the SDK only for purposes that are permitted
<br />
by (a) this Agreement, and (b) any applicable law, regulation
<br />
or generally accepted practices or guidelines in the relevant
<br />
jurisdictions.
<br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
1.1. License
<br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
1.1.1. License Grant
<br />
<br /><br />
Subject to the terms of this Agreement, NVIDIA hereby grants
<br />
you a non-exclusive, non-transferable license, without the
<br />
right to sublicense (except as expressly provided in this
<br />
Agreement) to:
<br />
<br /><br />
  1. Install and use the SDK,
<br />
<br /><br />
  2. Modify and create derivative works of sample source code
<br />
    delivered in the SDK, and
<br />
<br /><br />
  3. Distribute those portions of the SDK that are identified
<br />
    in this Agreement as distributable, as incorporated in
<br />
    object code format into a software application that meets
<br />
    the distribution requirements indicated in this Agreement.
<br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
1.1.2. Distribution Requirements
<br />
<br /><br />
These are the distribution requirements for you to exercise
<br />
the distribution grant:
<br />
<br /><br />
  1. Your application must have material additional
<br />
    functionality, beyond the included portions of the SDK.
<br />
<br /><br />
  2. The distributable portions of the SDK shall only be
<br />
    accessed by your application.
<br />
<br /><br />
  3. The following notice shall be included in modifications
<br />
    and derivative works of sample source code distributed:
<br />
    "This software contains source code provided by NVIDIA
<br />
    Corporation."
<br />
<br /><br />
  4. Unless a developer tool is identified in this Agreement
<br />
    as distributable, it is delivered for your internal use
<br />
    only.
<br />
<br /><br />
  5. The terms under which you distribute your application
<br />
    must be consistent with the terms of this Agreement,
<br />
    including (without limitation) terms relating to the
<br />
    license grant and license restrictions and protection of
<br />
    NVIDIA’s intellectual property rights. Additionally, you
<br />
    agree that you will protect the privacy, security and
<br />
    legal rights of your application users.
<br />
<br /><br />
  6. You agree to notify NVIDIA in writing of any known or
<br />
    suspected distribution or use of the SDK not in compliance
<br />
    with the requirements of this Agreement, and to enforce
<br />
    the terms of your agreements with respect to distributed
<br />
    SDK.
<br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
1.1.3. Authorized Users
<br />
<br /><br />
You may allow employees and contractors of your entity or of
<br />
your subsidiary(ies) to access and use the SDK from your
<br />
secure network to perform work on your behalf.
<br />
<br /><br />
If you are an academic institution you may allow users
<br />
enrolled or employed by the academic institution to access and
<br />
use the SDK from your secure network.
<br />
<br /><br />
You are responsible for the compliance with the terms of this
<br />
Agreement by your authorized users. If you become aware that
<br />
your authorized users didn’t follow the terms of this
<br />
Agreement, you agree to take reasonable steps to resolve the
<br />
non-compliance and prevent new occurrences.
<br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
1.1.4. Pre-Release SDK
<br />
<br /><br />
The SDK versions identified as alpha, beta, preview or
<br />
otherwise as pre-release, may not be fully functional, may
<br />
contain errors or design flaws, and may have reduced or
<br />
different security, privacy, accessibility, availability, and
<br />
reliability standards relative to commercial versions of
<br />
NVIDIA software and materials. Use of a pre-release SDK may
<br />
result in unexpected results, loss of data, project delays or
<br />
other unpredictable damage or loss.
<br />
<br /><br />
You may use a pre-release SDK at your own risk, understanding
<br />
that pre-release SDKs are not intended for use in production
<br />
or business-critical systems.
<br />
<br /><br />
NVIDIA may choose not to make available a commercial version
<br />
of any pre-release SDK. NVIDIA may also choose to abandon
<br />
development and terminate the availability of a pre-release
<br />
SDK at any time without liability.
<br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
1.1.5. Updates
<br />
<br /><br />
NVIDIA may, at its option, make available patches, workarounds
<br />
or other updates to this SDK. Unless the updates are provided
<br />
with their separate governing terms, they are deemed part of
<br />
the SDK licensed to you as provided in this Agreement. You
<br />
agree that the form and content of the SDK that NVIDIA
<br />
provides may change without prior notice to you. While NVIDIA
<br />
generally maintains compatibility between versions, NVIDIA may
<br />
in some cases make changes that introduce incompatibilities in
<br />
future versions of the SDK.
<br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
1.1.6. Third Party Licenses
<br />
<br /><br />
The SDK may come bundled with, or otherwise include or be
<br />
distributed with, third party software licensed by a NVIDIA
<br />
supplier and/or open source software provided under an open
<br />
source license. Use of third party software is subject to the
<br />
third-party license terms, or in the absence of third party
<br />
terms, the terms of this Agreement. Copyright to third party
<br />
software is held by the copyright holders indicated in the
<br />
third-party software or license.
<br />
<br /><br />
Subject to the other terms of this Agreement, you may use the
<br />
SDK to develop and test applications released under Open
<br />
Source Initiative (OSI) approved open source software
<br />
licenses.
<br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
1.1.7. Reservation of Rights
<br />
<br /><br />
NVIDIA reserves all rights, title, and interest in and to the
<br />
SDK, not expressly granted to you under this Agreement.
<br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
1.2. Limitations
<br />
<br /><br />
The following license limitations apply to your use of the
<br />
SDK:
<br />
<br /><br />
  1. You may not reverse engineer, decompile or disassemble,
<br />
    or remove copyright or other proprietary notices from any
<br />
    portion of the SDK or copies of the SDK.
<br />
<br /><br />
  2. Except as expressly provided in this Agreement, you may
<br />
    not copy, sell, rent, sublicense, transfer, distribute,
<br />
    modify, or create derivative works of any portion of the
<br />
    SDK. For clarity, you may not distribute or sublicense the
<br />
    SDK as a stand-alone product.
<br />
<br /><br />
  3. Unless you have an agreement with NVIDIA for this
<br />
    purpose, you may not indicate that an application created
<br />
    with the SDK is sponsored or endorsed by NVIDIA.
<br />
<br /><br />
  4. You may not bypass, disable, or circumvent any
<br />
    encryption, security, digital rights management or
<br />
    authentication mechanism in the SDK.
<br />
<br /><br />
  5. You may not use the SDK in any manner that would cause it
<br />
    to become subject to an open source software license. As
<br />
    examples, licenses that require as a condition of use,
<br />
    modification, and/or distribution that the SDK be:
<br />
<br /><br />
      a. Disclosed or distributed in source code form;
<br />
<br /><br />
      b. Licensed for the purpose of making derivative works;
<br />
        or
<br />
<br /><br />
      c. Redistributable at no charge.
<br />
<br /><br />
  6. Unless you have an agreement with NVIDIA for this
<br />
    purpose, you may not use the SDK with any system or
<br />
    application where the use or failure of the system or
<br />
    application can reasonably be expected to threaten or
<br />
    result in personal injury, death, or catastrophic loss.
<br />
    Examples include use in avionics, navigation, military,
<br />
    medical, life support or other life critical applications.
<br />
    NVIDIA does not design, test or manufacture the SDK for
<br />
    these critical uses and NVIDIA shall not be liable to you
<br />
    or any third party, in whole or in part, for any claims or
<br />
    damages arising from such uses.
<br />
<br /><br />
  7. You agree to defend, indemnify and hold harmless NVIDIA
<br />
    and its affiliates, and their respective employees,
<br />
    contractors, agents, officers and directors, from and
<br />
    against any and all claims, damages, obligations, losses,
<br />
    liabilities, costs or debt, fines, restitutions and
<br />
    expenses (including but not limited to attorney’s fees
<br />
    and costs incident to establishing the right of
<br />
    indemnification) arising out of or related to your use of
<br />
    the SDK outside of the scope of this Agreement, or not in
<br />
    compliance with its terms.
<br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
1.3. Ownership
<br />
<br /><br />
  1.  NVIDIA or its licensors hold all rights, title and
<br />
    interest in and to the SDK and its modifications and
<br />
    derivative works, including their respective intellectual
<br />
    property rights, subject to your rights under Section
<br />
    1.3.2. This SDK may include software and materials from
<br />
    NVIDIA’s licensors, and these licensors are intended
<br />
    third party beneficiaries that may enforce this Agreement
<br />
    with respect to their intellectual property rights.
<br />
<br /><br />
  2.  You hold all rights, title and interest in and to your
<br />
    applications and your derivative works of the sample
<br />
    source code delivered in the SDK, including their
<br />
    respective intellectual property rights, subject to
<br />
    NVIDIA’s rights under Section 1.3.1.
<br />
<br /><br />
  3. You may, but don’t have to, provide to NVIDIA
<br />
    suggestions, feature requests or other feedback regarding
<br />
    the SDK, including possible enhancements or modifications
<br />
    to the SDK. For any feedback that you voluntarily provide,
<br />
    you hereby grant NVIDIA and its affiliates a perpetual,
<br />
    non-exclusive, worldwide, irrevocable license to use,
<br />
    reproduce, modify, license, sublicense (through multiple
<br />
    tiers of sublicensees), and distribute (through multiple
<br />
    tiers of distributors) it without the payment of any
<br />
    royalties or fees to you. NVIDIA will use feedback at its
<br />
    choice. NVIDIA is constantly looking for ways to improve
<br />
    its products, so you may send feedback to NVIDIA through
<br />
    the developer portal at https://developer.nvidia.com.
<br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
1.4. No Warranties
<br />
<br /><br />
THE SDK IS PROVIDED BY NVIDIA "AS IS" AND "WITH ALL
<br />
FAULTS." TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, NVIDIA AND
<br />
ITS AFFILIATES EXPRESSLY DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND
<br />
OR NATURE, WHETHER EXPRESS, IMPLIED OR STATUTORY, INCLUDING,
<br />
BUT NOT LIMITED TO, ANY WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS
<br />
FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, OR THE
<br />
ABSENCE OF ANY DEFECTS THEREIN, WHETHER LATENT OR PATENT. NO
<br />
WARRANTY IS MADE ON THE BASIS OF TRADE USAGE, COURSE OF
<br />
DEALING OR COURSE OF TRADE.
<br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
1.5. Limitation of Liability
<br />
<br /><br />
TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, NVIDIA AND ITS
<br />
AFFILIATES SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL,
<br />
PUNITIVE OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, OR ANY LOST PROFITS, LOSS
<br />
OF USE, LOSS OF DATA OR LOSS OF GOODWILL, OR THE COSTS OF
<br />
PROCURING SUBSTITUTE PRODUCTS, ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION
<br />
WITH THIS AGREEMENT OR THE USE OR PERFORMANCE OF THE SDK,
<br />
WHETHER SUCH LIABILITY ARISES FROM ANY CLAIM BASED UPON BREACH
<br />
OF CONTRACT, BREACH OF WARRANTY, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE),
<br />
PRODUCT LIABILITY OR ANY OTHER CAUSE OF ACTION OR THEORY OF
<br />
LIABILITY. IN NO EVENT WILL NVIDIA’S AND ITS AFFILIATES
<br />
TOTAL CUMULATIVE LIABILITY UNDER OR ARISING OUT OF THIS
<br />
AGREEMENT EXCEED US$10.00. THE NATURE OF THE LIABILITY OR THE
<br />
NUMBER OF CLAIMS OR SUITS SHALL NOT ENLARGE OR EXTEND THIS
<br />
LIMIT.
<br />
<br /><br />
These exclusions and limitations of liability shall apply
<br />
regardless if NVIDIA or its affiliates have been advised of
<br />
the possibility of such damages, and regardless of whether a
<br />
remedy fails its essential purpose. These exclusions and
<br />
limitations of liability form an essential basis of the
<br />
bargain between the parties, and, absent any of these
<br />
exclusions or limitations of liability, the provisions of this
<br />
Agreement, including, without limitation, the economic terms,
<br />
would be substantially different.
<br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
1.6. Termination
<br />
<br /><br />
  1. This Agreement will continue to apply until terminated by
<br />
    either you or NVIDIA as described below.
<br />
<br /><br />
  2. If you want to terminate this Agreement, you may do so by
<br />
    stopping to use the SDK.
<br />
<br /><br />
  3. NVIDIA may, at any time, terminate this Agreement if:
<br />
<br /><br />
      a. (i) you fail to comply with any term of this
<br />
        Agreement and the non-compliance is not fixed within
<br />
        thirty (30) days following notice from NVIDIA (or
<br />
        immediately if you violate NVIDIA’s intellectual
<br />
        property rights);
<br />
<br /><br />
      b. (ii) you commence or participate in any legal
<br />
        proceeding against NVIDIA with respect to the SDK; or
<br />
<br /><br />
      c. (iii) NVIDIA decides to no longer provide the SDK in
<br />
        a country or, in NVIDIA’s sole discretion, the
<br />
        continued use of it is no longer commercially viable.
<br />
<br /><br />
  4. Upon any termination of this Agreement, you agree to
<br />
    promptly discontinue use of the SDK and destroy all copies
<br />
    in your possession or control. Your prior distributions in
<br />
    accordance with this Agreement are not affected by the
<br />
    termination of this Agreement. Upon written request, you
<br />
    will certify in writing that you have complied with your
<br />
    commitments under this section. Upon any termination of
<br />
    this Agreement all provisions survive except for the
<br />
    license grant provisions.
<br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
1.7. General
<br />
<br /><br />
If you wish to assign this Agreement or your rights and
<br />
obligations, including by merger, consolidation, dissolution
<br />
or operation of law, contact NVIDIA to ask for permission. Any
<br />
attempted assignment not approved by NVIDIA in writing shall
<br />
be void and of no effect. NVIDIA may assign, delegate or
<br />
transfer this Agreement and its rights and obligations, and if
<br />
to a non-affiliate you will be notified.
<br />
<br /><br />
You agree to cooperate with NVIDIA and provide reasonably
<br />
requested information to verify your compliance with this
<br />
Agreement.
<br />
<br /><br />
This Agreement will be governed in all respects by the laws of
<br />
the United States and of the State of Delaware as those laws
<br />
are applied to contracts entered into and performed entirely
<br />
within Delaware by Delaware residents, without regard to the
<br />
conflicts of laws principles. The United Nations Convention on
<br />
Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is specifically
<br />
disclaimed. You agree to all terms of this Agreement in the
<br />
English language.
<br />
<br /><br />
The state or federal courts residing in Santa Clara County,
<br />
California shall have exclusive jurisdiction over any dispute
<br />
or claim arising out of this Agreement. Notwithstanding this,
<br />
you agree that NVIDIA shall still be allowed to apply for
<br />
injunctive remedies or an equivalent type of urgent legal
<br />
relief in any jurisdiction.
<br />
<br /><br />
If any court of competent jurisdiction determines that any
<br />
provision of this Agreement is illegal, invalid or
<br />
unenforceable, such provision will be construed as limited to
<br />
the extent necessary to be consistent with and fully
<br />
enforceable under the law and the remaining provisions will
<br />
remain in full force and effect. Unless otherwise specified,
<br />
remedies are cumulative.
<br />
<br /><br />
Each party acknowledges and agrees that the other is an
<br />
independent contractor in the performance of this Agreement.

   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION
<br />
<br /><br />
   1. Definitions.
<br />
<br /><br />
      "License" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,

<br /><br />
      "Licensor" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by
<br />
      the copyright owner that is granting the License.
<br />
<br /><br />
      "Legal Entity" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all
<br />
      other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
<br />
      control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,
<br />
      "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
<br />
      direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
<br />
      otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
<br />
      outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.
<br />
<br /><br />
      "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
<br />
      exercising permissions granted by this License.
<br />
<br /><br />
      "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
<br />
      including but not limited to software source code, documentation
<br />
      source, and configuration files.
<br />
<br /><br />
      "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
<br />
      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
<br />
      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
<br />
      and conversions to other media types.
<br />
<br /><br />
      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
<br />
      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a

      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).
<br />
<br /><br />
      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
<br />
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
<br />
      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
<br />
      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
<br />
      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
<br />
      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
<br />
      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
<br />
<br /><br />
      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
<br />
      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
<br />
      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
<br />
      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
<br />
      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
<br />
      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
<br />
      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
<br />
      to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
<br />
      communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
<br />
      and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
<br />
      Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
<br />
      excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
<br />
      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."
<br />
<br /><br />
      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
<br />
      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
<br />
      subsequently incorporated within the Work.
<br />
<br /><br />
   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
<br />
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
<br />
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
<br />
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
<br />
      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
<br />
      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
<br />
<br /><br />
   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
<br />
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
<br />
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
<br />
      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
<br />
      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
<br />
      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
<br />
      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
<br />
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
<br />
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
<br />
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
<br />
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
<br />
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
<br />
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
<br />
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
<br />
      as of the date such litigation is filed.
<br />
<br /><br />
   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
<br />
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
<br />
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
<br />
      meet the following conditions:
<br />
<br /><br />
      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
<br />
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
<br />
<br /><br />
      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
<br />
          stating that You changed the files; and
<br />
<br /><br />
      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
<br />
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
<br />
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
<br />
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
<br />
          the Derivative Works; and
<br />
<br /><br />
      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
<br />
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
<br />
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
<br />
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
<br />
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
<br />
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
<br />
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
<br />
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
<br />
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
<br />
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
<br />
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
<br />
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
<br />
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
<br />
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
<br />
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
<br />
          as modifying the License.
<br />
<br /><br />
      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
<br />
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
<br />
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
<br />
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
<br />
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
<br />
      the conditions stated in this License.
<br />
<br /><br />
   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
<br />
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
<br />
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
<br />
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
<br />
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
<br />
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
<br />
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
<br />
<br /><br />
   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
<br />
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
<br />
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
<br />
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
<br />
<br /><br />
   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
<br />
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
<br />
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
<br />
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
<br />
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
<br />
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
<br />
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
<br />
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
<br />
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
<br />
<br /><br />
   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
<br />
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
<br />
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
<br />
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
<br />
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
<br />
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
<br />
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
<br />
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
<br />
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
<br />
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
<br />
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
<br />
<br /><br />
   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
<br />
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
<br />
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
<br />
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
<br />
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
<br />
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
<br />
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
<br />
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
<br />
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
<br />
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

<br />
<br /><br />

<br />
<br /><br />
2.3. Limitations on Grant Scope
<br />
<br /><br />
The licenses granted in this Section 2 are the only rights granted under
<br />
this License. No additional rights or licenses will be implied from the
<br />
distribution or licensing of Covered Software under this License.
<br />
Notwithstanding Section 2.1(b) above, no patent license is granted by a
<br />
Contributor:
<br />
<br /><br />
(a) for any code that a Contributor has removed from Covered Software;
<br />
    or

    its Contributions.
<br />
<br /><br />
This License does not grant any rights in the trademarks, service marks,

or logos of any Contributor (except as may be necessary to comply with
<br />
the notice requirements in Section 3.4).
<br />
<br /><br />
2.4. Subsequent Licenses
<br />
<br /><br />
No Contributor makes additional grants as a result of Your choice to
<br />
distribute the Covered Software under a subsequent version of this
<br />
License (see Section 10.2) or under the terms of a Secondary License (if
<br />
permitted under the terms of Section 3.3).
<br />
<br /><br />
2.5. Representation
<br />
<br /><br />
Each Contributor represents that the Contributor believes its
<br />
Contributions are its original creation(s) or it has sufficient rights
<br />
to grant the rights to its Contributions conveyed by this License.
<br />
<br /><br />
2.6. Fair Use
<br />
<br /><br />
This License is not intended to limit any rights You have under
<br />
applicable copyright doctrines of fair use, fair dealing, or other
<br />
equivalents.
<br />
<br /><br />
2.7. Conditions
<br />
<br /><br />
Sections 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, and 3.4 are conditions of the licenses granted
<br />
in Section 2.1.
<br />
<br /><br />
3. Responsibilities
<br />
-------------------
<br />
<br /><br />
3.1. Distribution of Source Form
<br />
<br /><br />
All distribution of Covered Software in Source Code Form, including any
<br />
Modifications that You create or to which You contribute, must be under
<br />
the terms of this License. You must inform recipients that the Source
<br />
Code Form of the Covered Software is governed by the terms of this
<br />
License, and how they can obtain a copy of this License. You may not
<br />
attempt to alter or restrict the recipients' rights in the Source Code
<br />
Form.
<br />
<br /><br />
3.2. Distribution of Executable Form
<br />
<br /><br />
If You distribute Covered Software in Executable Form then:
<br />
<br /><br />
(a) such Covered Software must also be made available in Source Code
<br />
    Form, as described in Section 3.1, and You must inform recipients of
<br />
    the Executable Form how they can obtain a copy of such Source Code
<br />
    Form by reasonable means in a timely manner, at a charge no more
<br />
    than the cost of distribution to the recipient; and
<br />
<br /><br />
(b) You may distribute such Executable Form under the terms of this
<br />
    License, or sublicense it under different terms, provided that the
<br />
    license for the Executable Form does not attempt to limit or alter
<br />
    the recipients' rights in the Source Code Form under this License.
<br />
<br /><br />
3.3. Distribution of a Larger Work
<br />
<br /><br />
You may create and distribute a Larger Work under terms of Your choice,
<br />
provided that You also comply with the requirements of this License for
<br />
the Covered Software. If the Larger Work is a combination of Covered
<br />
Software with a work governed by one or more Secondary Licenses, and the
<br />
Covered Software is not Incompatible With Secondary Licenses, this
<br />
License permits You to additionally distribute such Covered Software
<br />
under the terms of such Secondary License(s), so that the recipient of
<br />
the Larger Work may, at their option, further distribute the Covered
<br />
Software under the terms of either this License or such Secondary
<br />
License(s).
<br />
<br /><br />
3.4. Notices
<br />
<br /><br />
You may not remove or alter the substance of any license notices
<br />
(including copyright notices, patent notices, disclaimers of warranty,
<br />
or limitations of liability) contained within the Source Code Form of
<br />
the Covered Software, except that You may alter any license notices to
<br />
the extent required to remedy known factual inaccuracies.
<br />
<br /><br />
3.5. Application of Additional Terms
<br />
<br /><br />
You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support,
<br />
indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered
<br />
Software. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on
<br />
behalf of any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any
<br />
such warranty, support, indemnity, or liability obligation is offered by
<br />
You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify every Contributor for any
<br />
liability incurred by such Contributor as a result of warranty, support,
<br />
indemnity or liability terms You offer. You may include additional
<br />
disclaimers of warranty and limitations of liability specific to any
<br />
jurisdiction.
<br />
<br /><br />
4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation
<br />
---------------------------------------------------
<br />
<br /><br />
If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this
<br />
License with respect to some or all of the Covered Software due to
<br />
statute, judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with
<br />
the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b)
<br />
describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description must
<br />
be placed in a text file included with all distributions of the Covered
<br />
Software under this License. Except to the extent prohibited by statute
<br />
or regulation, such description must be sufficiently detailed for a
<br />
recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it.
<br />
<br /><br />
5. Termination
<br />
--------------
<br />
<br /><br />
5.1. The rights granted under this License will terminate automatically
<br />
if You fail to comply with any of its terms. However, if You become
<br />
compliant, then the rights granted under this License from a particular
<br />
Contributor are reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until such
<br />
Contributor explicitly and finally terminates Your grants, and (b) on an
<br />
ongoing basis, if such Contributor fails to notify You of the
<br />
non-compliance by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after You have
<br />
come back into compliance. Moreover, Your grants from a particular
<br />
Contributor are reinstated on an ongoing basis if such Contributor
<br />
notifies You of the non-compliance by some reasonable means, this is the
<br />
first time You have received notice of non-compliance with this License
<br />
from such Contributor, and You become compliant prior to 30 days after
<br />
Your receipt of the notice.
<br />
<br /><br />
5.2. If You initiate litigation against any entity by asserting a patent
<br />
infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions,
<br />
counter-claims, and cross-claims) alleging that a Contributor Version
<br />
directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then the rights granted to
<br />
You by any and all Contributors for the Covered Software under Section
<br />
2.1 of this License shall terminate.
<br />
<br /><br />
5.3. In the event of termination under Sections 5.1 or 5.2 above, all
<br />
end user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which
<br />
have been validly granted by You or Your distributors under this License
<br />
prior to termination shall survive termination.

<br />

<br />

<br />
*  Under no circumstances and under no legal theory, whether tort      *
<br />
*  (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, shall any           *
<br />
*  Contributor, or anyone who distributes Covered Software as          *
<br />
*  permitted above, be liable to You for any direct, indirect,         *

<br /><br />
1.14. "You" (or "Your")
<br />
    means an individual or a legal entity exercising rights under this
<br />
    License. For legal entities, "You" includes any entity that
<br />
    controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with You. For
<br />
    purposes of this definition, "control" means (a) the power, direct
<br />
    or indirect, to cause the direction or management of such entity,
<br />
    whether by contract or otherwise, or (b) ownership of more than
<br />
    fifty percent (50%) of the outstanding shares or beneficial
<br />
    ownership of such entity.
<br />
<br /><br />
2. License Grants and Conditions
<br />
--------------------------------
<br />
<br /><br />
2.1. Grants
<br />
<br /><br />
Each Contributor hereby grants You a world-wide, royalty-free,
<br />
non-exclusive license:
<br />
<br /><br />
(a) under intellectual property rights (other than patent or trademark)
<br />
    Licensable by such Contributor to use, reproduce, make available,
<br />
    modify, display, perform, distribute, and otherwise exploit its
<br />
    Contributions, either on an unmodified basis, with Modifications, or
<br />
    as part of a Larger Work; and
<br />
<br /><br />
(b) under Patent Claims of such Contributor to make, use, sell, offer
<br />
    for sale, have made, import, and otherwise transfer either its
<br />
    Contributions or its Contributor Version.
<br />
<br /><br />
2.2. Effective Date
<br />
<br /><br />
The licenses granted in Section 2.1 with respect to any Contribution
<br />
become effective for each Contribution on the date the Contributor first
<br />
distributes such Contribution.
<br />
<br /><br />
2.3. Limitations on Grant Scope
<br />
<br /><br />
The licenses granted in this Section 2 are the only rights granted under
<br />
this License. No additional rights or licenses will be implied from the
<br />
distribution or licensing of Covered Software under this License.
<br />
Notwithstanding Section 2.1(b) above, no patent license is granted by a
<br />
Contributor:
<br />
<br /><br />
(a) for any code that a Contributor has removed from Covered Software;
<br />
    or
<br />
<br /><br />
(b) for infringements caused by: (i) Your and any other third party's
<br />
    modifications of Covered Software, or (ii) the combination of its
<br />
    Contributions with other software (except as part of its Contributor
<br />
    Version); or
<br />
<br /><br />
(c) under Patent Claims infringed by Covered Software in the absence of
<br />
    its Contributions.
<br />
<br /><br />
This License does not grant any rights in the trademarks, service marks,
<br />
or logos of any Contributor (except as may be necessary to comply with
<br />
the notice requirements in Section 3.4).
<br />
<br /><br />
2.4. Subsequent Licenses
<br />
<br /><br />
No Contributor makes additional grants as a result of Your choice to
<br />
distribute the Covered Software under a subsequent version of this
<br />
License (see Section 10.2) or under the terms of a Secondary License (if
<br />
permitted under the terms of Section 3.3).
<br />
<br /><br />
2.5. Representation
<br />
<br /><br />
Each Contributor represents that the Contributor believes its
<br />
Contributions are its original creation(s) or it has sufficient rights
<br />
to grant the rights to its Contributions conveyed by this License.
<br />
<br /><br />
2.6. Fair Use
<br />
<br /><br />
This License is not intended to limit any rights You have under
<br />
applicable copyright doctrines of fair use, fair dealing, or other
<br />
equivalents.
<br />
<br /><br />
2.7. Conditions
<br />
<br /><br />
Sections 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, and 3.4 are conditions of the licenses granted
<br />
in Section 2.1.
<br />
<br /><br />
3. Responsibilities
<br />
-------------------
<br />
<br /><br />
3.1. Distribution of Source Form
<br />
<br /><br />
All distribution of Covered Software in Source Code Form, including any
<br />
Modifications that You create or to which You contribute, must be under
<br />
the terms of this License. You must inform recipients that the Source
<br />
Code Form of the Covered Software is governed by the terms of this
<br />
License, and how they can obtain a copy of this License. You may not
<br />
attempt to alter or restrict the recipients' rights in the Source Code
<br />
Form.
<br />
<br /><br />
3.2. Distribution of Executable Form
<br />
<br /><br />
If You distribute Covered Software in Executable Form then:
<br />
<br /><br />
(a) such Covered Software must also be made available in Source Code
<br />
    Form, as described in Section 3.1, and You must inform recipients of
<br />
    the Executable Form how they can obtain a copy of such Source Code
<br />
    Form by reasonable means in a timely manner, at a charge no more
<br />
    than the cost of distribution to the recipient; and
<br />
<br /><br />
(b) You may distribute such Executable Form under the terms of this
<br />
    License, or sublicense it under different terms, provided that the
<br />
    license for the Executable Form does not attempt to limit or alter
<br />
    the recipients' rights in the Source Code Form under this License.
<br />
<br /><br />
3.3. Distribution of a Larger Work
<br />
<br /><br />
You may create and distribute a Larger Work under terms of Your choice,
<br />
provided that You also comply with the requirements of this License for
<br />
the Covered Software. If the Larger Work is a combination of Covered
<br />
Software with a work governed by one or more Secondary Licenses, and the
<br />
Covered Software is not Incompatible With Secondary Licenses, this
<br />
License permits You to additionally distribute such Covered Software
<br />
under the terms of such Secondary License(s), so that the recipient of
<br />
the Larger Work may, at their option, further distribute the Covered
<br />
Software under the terms of either this License or such Secondary
<br />
License(s).
<br />
<br /><br />
3.4. Notices
<br />
<br /><br />
You may not remove or alter the substance of any license notices
<br />
(including copyright notices, patent notices, disclaimers of warranty,
<br />
or limitations of liability) contained within the Source Code Form of
<br />
the Covered Software, except that You may alter any license notices to
<br />
the extent required to remedy known factual inaccuracies.
<br />
<br /><br />
3.5. Application of Additional Terms
<br />
<br /><br />
You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support,
<br />
indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered
<br />
Software. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on
<br />
behalf of any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any
<br />
such warranty, support, indemnity, or liability obligation is offered by
<br />
You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify every Contributor for any
<br />
liability incurred by such Contributor as a result of warranty, support,
<br />
indemnity or liability terms You offer. You may include additional
<br />
disclaimers of warranty and limitations of liability specific to any
<br />
jurisdiction.
<br />
<br /><br />
4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation
<br />
---------------------------------------------------
<br />
<br /><br />
If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this
<br />
License with respect to some or all of the Covered Software due to
<br />
statute, judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with
<br />
the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b)
<br />
describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description must
<br />
be placed in a text file included with all distributions of the Covered
<br />
Software under this License. Except to the extent prohibited by statute
<br />
or regulation, such description must be sufficiently detailed for a
<br />
recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it.
<br />
<br /><br />
5. Termination
<br />
--------------
<br />
<br /><br />
5.1. The rights granted under this License will terminate automatically
<br />
if You fail to comply with any of its terms. However, if You become
<br />
compliant, then the rights granted under this License from a particular
<br />
Contributor are reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until such
<br />
Contributor explicitly and finally terminates Your grants, and (b) on an
<br />
ongoing basis, if such Contributor fails to notify You of the
<br />
non-compliance by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after You have
<br />
come back into compliance. Moreover, Your grants from a particular
<br />
Contributor are reinstated on an ongoing basis if such Contributor
<br />
notifies You of the non-compliance by some reasonable means, this is the
<br />
first time You have received notice of non-compliance with this License
<br />
from such Contributor, and You become compliant prior to 30 days after
<br />
Your receipt of the notice.
<br />
<br /><br />
5.2. If You initiate litigation against any entity by asserting a patent
<br />
infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions,
<br />
counter-claims, and cross-claims) alleging that a Contributor Version
<br />
directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then the rights granted to
<br />
You by any and all Contributors for the Covered Software under Section
<br />
2.1 of this License shall terminate.
<br />
<br /><br />
5.3. In the event of termination under Sections 5.1 or 5.2 above, all
<br />
end user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which
<br />
have been validly granted by You or Your distributors under this License
<br />
prior to termination shall survive termination.

GNU General Public License, version 3 (GPL-3.0)
<br />
[OSI Approved License]
<br />
GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
<br />
<br /><br />
Version 3, 29 June 2007
<br />
<br /><br />
Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <http://fsf.org/>
<br />
<br /><br />
Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
<br />
Preamble
<br />
<br /><br />
The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for software and other kinds of works.
<br />
<br /><br />
The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed to take away your freedom to share and change the works. By contrast, the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free software for all its users. We, the Free Software Foundation, use the GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to any other work released this way by its authors. You can apply it to your programs, too.
<br />
<br /><br />
When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free programs, and that you know you can do these things.
<br />
<br /><br />
To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you these rights or asking you to surrender the rights. Therefore, you have certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.
<br />
<br /><br />
For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same freedoms that you received. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.
<br />
<br /><br />
Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps: (1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.
<br />
<br /><br />
For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains that there is no warranty for this free software. For both users' and authors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to authors of previous versions.
<br />
<br /><br />
Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run modified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer can do so. This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of protecting users' freedom to change the software. The systematic pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable. Therefore, we have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those products. If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.
<br />
<br /><br />
Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents. States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could make it effectively proprietary. To prevent this, the GPL assures that patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.
<br />
<br /><br />
The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow.
<br />
TERMS AND CONDITIONS
<br />
0. Definitions.
<br />
<br /><br />
�This License� refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.
<br />
<br /><br />
�Copyright� also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of works, such as semiconductor masks.
<br />
<br /><br />
�The Program� refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this License. Each licensee is addressed as �you�. �Licensees� and �recipients� may be individuals or organizations.
<br />
<br /><br />
To �modify� a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an exact copy. The resulting work is called a �modified version� of the earlier work or a work �based on� the earlier work.
<br />
<br /><br />
A �covered work� means either the unmodified Program or a work based on the Program.
<br />
<br /><br />
To �propagate� a work means to do anything with it that, without permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a computer or modifying a private copy. Propagation includes copying, distribution (with or without modification), making available to the public, and in some countries other activities as well.
<br />
<br /><br />
To �convey� a work means any kind of propagation that enables other parties to make or receive copies. Mere interaction with a user through a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.
<br />
<br /><br />
An interactive user interface displays �Appropriate Legal Notices� to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2) tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License. If the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.
<br />
1. Source Code.
<br />
<br /><br />
The �source code� for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it. �Object code� means any non-source form of a work.
<br />
<br /><br />
A �Standard Interface� means an interface that either is an official standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that is widely used among developers working in that language.
<br />
<br /><br />
The �System Libraries� of an executable work include anything, other than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an implementation is available to the public in source code form. A �Major Component�, in this context, means a major essential component (kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system (if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.
<br />
<br /><br />
The �Corresponding Source� for a work in object code form means all the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to control those activities. However, it does not include the work's System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but which are not part of the work. For example, Corresponding Source includes interface definition files associated with source files for the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require, such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those subprograms and other parts of the work.
<br />
<br /><br />
The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users can regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding Source.
<br />
<br /><br />
The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that same work.
<br />
2. Basic Permissions.
<br />
<br /><br />
All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated conditions are met. This License explicitly affirms your unlimited permission to run the unmodified Program. The output from running a covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its content, constitutes a covered work. This License acknowledges your rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.
<br />
<br /><br />
You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains in force. You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose of having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you with facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do not control copyright. Those thus making or running the covered works for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.
<br />
<br /><br />
Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under the conditions stated below. Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10 makes it unnecessary.
<br />
3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.
<br />
<br /><br />
No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article 11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such measures.
<br />
<br /><br />
When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's users, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of technological measures.
<br />
4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.
<br />
<br /><br />
You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice; keep intact all notices stating that this License and any non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code; keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.
<br />
<br /><br />
You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey, and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.
<br />
5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.
<br />
<br /><br />
You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:
<br />
<br /><br />
    a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified it, and giving a relevant date.
<br />
    b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is released under this License and any conditions added under section 7. This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to �keep intact all notices�.
<br />
    c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy. This License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7 additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts, regardless of how they are packaged. This License gives no permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.
<br />
    d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your work need not make them do so.
<br />
<br /><br />
A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work, and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program, in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an �aggregate� if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users beyond what the individual works permit. Inclusion of a covered work in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other parts of the aggregate.
<br />
6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.
<br />
<br /><br />
You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License, in one of these ways:
<br />
<br /><br />
    a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium customarily used for software interchange.
<br />
    b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.
<br />
    c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the written offer to provide the Corresponding Source. This alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord with subsection 6b.
<br />
    d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no further charge. You need not require recipients to copy the Corresponding Source along with the object code. If the place to copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party) that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the Corresponding Source. Regardless of what server hosts the Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.
<br />
    e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no charge under subsection 6d.
<br />
<br /><br />
A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be included in conveying the object code work.
<br />
<br /><br />
A �User Product� is either (1) a �consumer product�, which means any tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family, or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation into a dwelling. In determining whether a product is a consumer product, doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage. For a particular product received by a particular user, �normally used� refers to a typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status of the particular user or of the way in which the particular user actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product. A product is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent the only significant mode of use of the product.
<br />
<br /><br />
�Installation Information� for a User Product means any methods, procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from a modified version of its Corresponding Source. The information must suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because modification has been made.
<br />
<br /><br />
If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied by the Installation Information. But this requirement does not apply if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install modified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has been installed in ROM).
<br />
<br /><br />
The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for the User Product in which it has been modified or installed. Access to a network may be denied when the modification itself materially and adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and protocols for communication across the network.
<br />
<br /><br />
Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided, in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly documented (and with an implementation available to the public in source code form), and must require no special password or key for unpacking, reading or copying.
<br />
7. Additional Terms.
<br />
<br /><br />
�Additional permissions� are terms that supplement the terms of this License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions. Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent that they are valid under applicable law. If additional permissions apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by this License without regard to the additional permissions.
<br />
<br /><br />
When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of it. (Additional permissions may be written to require their own removal in certain cases when you modify the work.) You may place additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work, for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.
<br />
<br /><br />
Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:
<br />
<br /><br />
    a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or
<br />
    b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal Notices displayed by works containing it; or
<br />
    c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in reasonable ways as different from the original version; or
<br />
    d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or authors of the material; or
<br />
    e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or
<br />
    f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on those licensors and authors.
<br />
<br /><br />
All other non-permissive additional terms are considered �further restrictions� within the meaning of section 10. If the Program as you received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is governed by this License along with a term that is a further restriction, you may remove that term. If a license document contains a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms of that license document, provided that the further restriction does not survive such relicensing or conveying.
<br />
<br /><br />
If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating where to find the applicable terms.
<br />
<br /><br />
Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions; the above requirements apply either way.
<br />
8. Termination.
<br />
<br /><br />
You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to propagate or modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third paragraph of section 11).
<br />
<br /><br />
However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after the cessation.
<br />
<br /><br />
Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after your receipt of the notice.
<br />
<br /><br />
Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under this License. If your rights have been terminated and not permanently reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same material under section 10.
<br />
9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.
<br />
<br /><br />
You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or run a copy of the Program. Ancillary propagation of a covered work occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance. However, nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or modify any covered work. These actions infringe copyright if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or propagating a covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.
<br />
10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.
<br />
<br /><br />
Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and propagate that work, subject to this License. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.
<br />
<br /><br />
An �entity transaction� is a transaction transferring control of an organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an organization, or merging organizations. If propagation of a covered work results from an entity transaction, each party to that transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever licenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.
<br />
<br /><br />
You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the rights granted or affirmed under this License. For example, you may not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.
<br />
11. Patents.
<br />
<br /><br />
A �contributor� is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based. The work thus licensed is called the contributor's �contributor version�.
<br />
<br /><br />
A contributor's �essential patent claims� are all patent claims owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted by this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version, but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a consequence of further modification of the contributor version. For purposes of this definition, �control� includes the right to grant patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of this License.
<br />
<br /><br />
Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and propagate the contents of its contributor version.
<br />
<br /><br />
In the following three paragraphs, a �patent license� is any express agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent (such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to sue for patent infringement). To �grant� such a patent license to a party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a patent against the party.
<br />
<br /><br />
If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license, and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a publicly available network server or other readily accessible means, then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent license to downstream recipients. �Knowingly relying� means you have actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the covered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that country that you have reason to believe are valid.
<br />
<br /><br />
If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered work and works based on it.
<br />
<br /><br />
A patent license is �discriminatory� if it does not include within the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are specifically granted under this License. You may not convey a covered work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is in the business of distributing software, under which you make payment to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily for and in connection with specific products or compilations that contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement, or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.
<br />
<br /><br />
Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.
<br />
12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.
<br />
<br /><br />
If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot convey a covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not convey it at all. For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.
<br />
13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.
<br />
<br /><br />
Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed under version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single combined work, and to convey the resulting work. The terms of this License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work, but the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License, section 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the combination as such.
<br />
14. Revised Versions of this License.
<br />
<br /><br />
The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the GNU General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.
<br />
<br /><br />
Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General Public License �or any later version� applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version number of the GNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.
<br />
<br /><br />
If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future versions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy's public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you to choose that version for the Program.
<br />
<br /><br />
Later license versions may give you additional or different permissions. However, no additional obligations are imposed on any author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a later version.
<br />
15. Disclaimer of Warranty.
<br />
<br /><br />
THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM �AS IS� WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
<br />
16. Limitation of Liability.
<br />
<br /><br />
IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
<br />
17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.
<br />
<br /><br />
If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms, reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the Program, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a copy of the Program in return for a fee.
<br />
<br /><br />
END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
<br />
How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs
<br />
<br /><br />
If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.
<br />
<br /><br />
To do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively state the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the �copyright� line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.
<br />
<br /><br />
    <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>
<br />
    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>
<br />
<br /><br />
    This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify
<br />
    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
<br />
    the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or
<br />
    (at your option) any later version.
<br />
<br /><br />
    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
<br />
    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
<br />
    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the
<br />
    GNU General Public License for more details.
<br />
<br /><br />
    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
<br />
    along with this program.  If not, see <http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.
<br />
<br /><br />
Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.
<br />
<br /><br />
If the program does terminal interaction, make it output a short notice like this when it starts in an interactive mode:
<br />
<br /><br />
    <program>  Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>
<br />
<br /><br />
    This program comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.
<br />
    This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it
<br />
    under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.
<br />
<br /><br />
The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate parts of the General Public License. Of course, your program's commands might be different; for a GUI interface, you would use an �about box�.
<br />
<br /><br />
You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school, if any, to sign a �copyright disclaimer� for the program, if necessary. For more information on this, and how to apply and follow the GNU GPL, see <http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.
<br />
<br /><br />
The GNU General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into proprietary programs. If your program is a subroutine library, you may consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the library. If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General Public License instead of this License. But first, please read <http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/why-not-lgpl.html>.

                    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
<br />
                       Version 3, 29 June 2007
<br />
<br /><br />
 Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <http://fsf.org/>
<br />
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
<br />
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
<br />
<br /><br />
                            Preamble
<br />
<br /><br />
  The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for
<br />
software and other kinds of works.
<br />
<br /><br />
  The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed
<br />
to take away your freedom to share and change the works.  By contrast,
<br />
the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to
<br />
share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free
<br />
software for all its users.  We, the Free Software Foundation, use the
<br />
GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to
<br />
any other work released this way by its authors.  You can apply it to
<br />
your programs, too.
<br />
<br /><br />
  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
<br />
price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
<br />
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
<br />
them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you
<br />
want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new
<br />
free programs, and that you know you can do these things.
<br />
<br /><br />
  To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you
<br />
these rights or asking you to surrender the rights.  Therefore, you have
<br />
certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if
<br />
you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.
<br />
<br /><br />
  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
<br />
gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same
<br />
freedoms that you received.  You must make sure that they, too, receive
<br />
or can get the source code.  And you must show them these terms so they
<br />
know their rights.
<br />
<br /><br />
  Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:
<br />
(1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License
<br />
giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.
<br />
<br /><br />
  For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains
<br />
that there is no warranty for this free software.  For both users' and
<br />
authors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as
<br />
changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to
<br />
authors of previous versions.
<br />
<br /><br />
  Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run
<br />
modified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer
<br />
can do so.  This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of
<br />
protecting users' freedom to change the software.  The systematic
<br />
pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to
<br />
use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable.  Therefore, we
<br />
have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those
<br />
products.  If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we
<br />
stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions
<br />
of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.
<br />
<br /><br />
  Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.
<br />
States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of
<br />
software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to
<br />
avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could
<br />
make it effectively proprietary.  To prevent this, the GPL assures that
<br />
patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.
<br />
<br /><br />
  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
<br />
modification follow.
<br />
<br /><br />
                       TERMS AND CONDITIONS
<br />
<br /><br />
  0. Definitions.
<br />
<br /><br />
  "This License" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.
<br />
<br /><br />
  "Copyright" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of
<br />
works, such as semiconductor masks.
<br />
<br /><br />
  "The Program" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this
<br />
License.  Each licensee is addressed as "you".  "Licensees" and
<br />
"recipients" may be individuals or organizations.
<br />
<br /><br />
  To "modify" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work
<br />
in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an
<br />
exact copy.  The resulting work is called a "modified version" of the
<br />
earlier work or a work "based on" the earlier work.
<br />
<br /><br />
  A "covered work" means either the unmodified Program or a work based
<br />
on the Program.
<br />
<br /><br />
  To "propagate" a work means to do anything with it that, without
<br />
permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for
<br />
infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a
<br />
computer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes copying,
<br />
distribution (with or without modification), making available to the
<br />
public, and in some countries other activities as well.
<br />
<br /><br />
  To "convey" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other
<br />
parties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user through
<br />
a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.
<br />
<br /><br />
  An interactive user interface displays "Appropriate Legal Notices"
<br />
to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible
<br />
feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)
<br />
tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the
<br />
extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the
<br />
work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.  If
<br />
the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a
<br />
menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.
<br />
<br /><br />
  1. Source Code.
<br />
<br /><br />
  The "source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work
<br />
for making modifications to it.  "Object code" means any non-source
<br />
form of a work.
<br />
<br /><br />
  A "Standard Interface" means an interface that either is an official
<br />
standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of
<br />
interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that
<br />
is widely used among developers working in that language.
<br />
<br /><br />
  The "System Libraries" of an executable work include anything, other
<br />
than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of
<br />
packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major
<br />
Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that
<br />
Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an
<br />
implementation is available to the public in source code form.  A
<br />
"Major Component", in this context, means a major essential component
<br />
(kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system
<br />
(if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to
<br />
produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.
<br />
<br /><br />
  The "Corresponding Source" for a work in object code form means all
<br />
the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable
<br />
work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to
<br />
control those activities.  However, it does not include the work's
<br />
System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free
<br />
programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but
<br />
which are not part of the work.  For example, Corresponding Source
<br />
includes interface definition files associated with source files for
<br />
the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically
<br />
linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,
<br />
such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those
<br />
subprograms and other parts of the work.
<br />
<br /><br />
  The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users
<br />
can regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding
<br />
Source.
<br />
<br /><br />
  The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that
<br />
same work.
<br />
<br /><br />
  2. Basic Permissions.
<br />
<br /><br />
  All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of
<br />
copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated
<br />
conditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited
<br />
permission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running a
<br />
covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its
<br />
content, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges your
<br />
rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.
<br />
<br /><br />
  You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not
<br />
convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains
<br />
in force.  You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose
<br />
of having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you
<br />
with facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with
<br />
the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do
<br />
not control copyright.  Those thus making or running the covered works
<br />
for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction
<br />
and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of
<br />
your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.
<br />
<br /><br />
  Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under
<br />
the conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10
<br />
makes it unnecessary.
<br />
<br /><br />
  3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.
<br />
<br /><br />
  No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological
<br />
measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article
<br />
11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or
<br />
similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such
<br />
measures.
<br />
<br /><br />
  When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid
<br />
circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention
<br />
is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to
<br />
the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or
<br />
modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's
<br />
users, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of
<br />
technological measures.
<br />
<br /><br />
  4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.
<br />
<br /><br />
  You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you
<br />
receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and
<br />
appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;
<br />
keep intact all notices stating that this License and any
<br />
non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;
<br />
keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all
<br />
recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.
<br />
<br /><br />
  You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,
<br />
and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.
<br />
<br /><br />
  5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.
<br />
<br /><br />
  You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to
<br />
produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the
<br />
terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:
<br />
<br /><br />
    a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified
<br />
    it, and giving a relevant date.
<br />
<br /><br />
    b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is
<br />
    released under this License and any conditions added under section
<br />
    7.  This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to
<br />
    "keep intact all notices".
<br />
<br /><br />
    c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this
<br />
    License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This
<br />
    License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7
<br />
    additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,
<br />
    regardless of how they are packaged.  This License gives no
<br />
    permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not
<br />
    invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.
<br />
<br /><br />
    d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display
<br />
    Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive
<br />
    interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your
<br />
    work need not make them do so.
<br />
<br /><br />
  A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent
<br />
works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,
<br />
and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,
<br />
in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an
<br />
"aggregate" if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not
<br />
used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users
<br />
beyond what the individual works permit.  Inclusion of a covered work
<br />
in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other
<br />
parts of the aggregate.
<br />
<br /><br />
  6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.
<br />
<br /><br />
  You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms
<br />
of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the
<br />
machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,
<br />
in one of these ways:
<br />
<br /><br />
    a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
<br />
    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the
<br />
    Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium
<br />
    customarily used for software interchange.
<br />
<br /><br />
    b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
<br />
    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a
<br />
    written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as
<br />
    long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product
<br />
    model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a
<br />
    copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the
<br />
    product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical
<br />
    medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no
<br />
    more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this
<br />
    conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the
<br />
    Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.
<br />
<br /><br />
    c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the
<br />
    written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This
<br />
    alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and
<br />
    only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord
<br />
    with subsection 6b.
<br />
<br /><br />
    d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated
<br />
    place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the
<br />
    Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no
<br />
    further charge.  You need not require recipients to copy the
<br />
    Corresponding Source along with the object code.  If the place to
<br />
    copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source
<br />
    may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)
<br />
    that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain
<br />
    clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the
<br />
    Corresponding Source.  Regardless of what server hosts the
<br />
    Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is
<br />
    available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.
<br />
<br /><br />
    e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided
<br />
    you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding
<br />
    Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no
<br />
    charge under subsection 6d.
<br />
<br /><br />
  A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded
<br />
from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be
<br />
included in conveying the object code work.
<br />
<br /><br />
  A "User Product" is either (1) a "consumer product", which means any
<br />
tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,
<br />
or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation
<br />
into a dwelling.  In determining whether a product is a consumer product,
<br />
doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.  For a particular
<br />
product received by a particular user, "normally used" refers to a
<br />
typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status
<br />
of the particular user or of the way in which the particular user
<br />
actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product.  A product
<br />
is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial
<br />
commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent
<br />
the only significant mode of use of the product.
<br />
<br /><br />
  "Installation Information" for a User Product means any methods,
<br />
procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install
<br />
and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from
<br />
a modified version of its Corresponding Source.  The information must
<br />
suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object
<br />
code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because
<br />
modification has been made.
<br />
<br /><br />
  If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or
<br />
specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as
<br />
part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the
<br />
User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a
<br />
fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the
<br />
Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied
<br />
by the Installation Information.  But this requirement does not apply
<br />
if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install
<br />
modified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has
<br />
been installed in ROM).
<br />
<br /><br />
  The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a
<br />
requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates
<br />
for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for
<br />
the User Product in which it has been modified or installed.  Access to a
<br />
network may be denied when the modification itself materially and
<br />
adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and
<br />
protocols for communication across the network.
<br />
<br /><br />
  Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,
<br />
in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly
<br />
documented (and with an implementation available to the public in
<br />
source code form), and must require no special password or key for
<br />
unpacking, reading or copying.
<br />
<br /><br />
  7. Additional Terms.
<br />
<br /><br />
  "Additional permissions" are terms that supplement the terms of this
<br />
License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.
<br />
Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall
<br />
be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent
<br />
that they are valid under applicable law.  If additional permissions
<br />
apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately
<br />
under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by
<br />
this License without regard to the additional permissions.
<br />
<br /><br />
  When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option
<br />
remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of
<br />
it.  (Additional permissions may be written to require their own
<br />
removal in certain cases when you modify the work.)  You may place
<br />
additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,
<br />
for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.
<br />
<br /><br />
  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you
<br />
add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of
<br />
that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:
<br />
<br /><br />
    a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the
<br />
    terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or
<br />
<br /><br />
    b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or
<br />
    author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal
<br />
    Notices displayed by works containing it; or
<br />
<br /><br />
    c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or
<br />
    requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in
<br />
    reasonable ways as different from the original version; or
<br />
<br /><br />
    d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or
<br />
    authors of the material; or
<br />
<br /><br />
    e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some
<br />
    trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or
<br />
<br /><br />
    f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that
<br />
    material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of
<br />
    it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for
<br />
    any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on
<br />
    those licensors and authors.
<br />
<br /><br />
  All other non-permissive additional terms are considered "further
<br />
restrictions" within the meaning of section 10.  If the Program as you
<br />
received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is
<br />
governed by this License along with a term that is a further
<br />
restriction, you may remove that term.  If a license document contains
<br />
a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this
<br />
License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms
<br />
of that license document, provided that the further restriction does
<br />
not survive such relicensing or conveying.
<br />
<br /><br />
  If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you
<br />
must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the
<br />
additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating
<br />
where to find the applicable terms.
<br />
<br /><br />
  Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the
<br />
form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;
<br />
the above requirements apply either way.
<br />
<br /><br />
  8. Termination.
<br />
<br /><br />
  You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly
<br />
provided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or
<br />
modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under
<br />
this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third
<br />
paragraph of section 11).
<br />
<br /><br />
  However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your
<br />
license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)
<br />
provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and
<br />
finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright
<br />
holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means
<br />
prior to 60 days after the cessation.
<br />
<br /><br />
  Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is
<br />
reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the
<br />
violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have
<br />
received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that
<br />
copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after
<br />
your receipt of the notice.
<br />
<br /><br />
  Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the
<br />
licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under
<br />
this License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently
<br />
reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same
<br />
material under section 10.
<br />
<br /><br />
  9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.
<br />
<br /><br />
  You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or
<br />
run a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work
<br />
occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission
<br />
to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.  However,
<br />
nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or
<br />
modify any covered work.  These actions infringe copyright if you do
<br />
not accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or propagating a
<br />
covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.
<br />
<br /><br />
  10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.
<br />
<br /><br />
  Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically
<br />
receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and
<br />
propagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not responsible
<br />
for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.
<br />
<br /><br />
  An "entity transaction" is a transaction transferring control of an
<br />
organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an
<br />
organization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a covered
<br />
work results from an entity transaction, each party to that
<br />
transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever
<br />
licenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could
<br />
give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the
<br />
Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if
<br />
the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.
<br />
<br /><br />
  You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the
<br />
rights granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you may
<br />
not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of
<br />
rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation
<br />
(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that
<br />
any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for
<br />
sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.
<br />
<br /><br />
  11. Patents.
<br />
<br /><br />
  A "contributor" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this
<br />
License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.  The
<br />
work thus licensed is called the contributor's "contributor version".
<br />
<br /><br />
  A contributor's "essential patent claims" are all patent claims
<br />
owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or
<br />
hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted
<br />
by this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,
<br />
but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a
<br />
consequence of further modification of the contributor version.  For
<br />
purposes of this definition, "control" includes the right to grant
<br />
patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of
<br />
this License.
<br />
<br /><br />
  Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free
<br />
patent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to
<br />
make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and
<br />
propagate the contents of its contributor version.
<br />
<br /><br />
  In the following three paragraphs, a "patent license" is any express
<br />
agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent
<br />
(such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to
<br />
sue for patent infringement).  To "grant" such a patent license to a
<br />
party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a
<br />
patent against the party.
<br />
<br /><br />
  If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,
<br />
and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone
<br />
to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a
<br />
publicly available network server or other readily accessible means,
<br />
then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so
<br />
available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the
<br />
patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner
<br />
consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent
<br />
license to downstream recipients.  "Knowingly relying" means you have
<br />
actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the
<br />
covered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work
<br />
in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that
<br />
country that you have reason to believe are valid.
<br />
<br /><br />
  If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or
<br />
arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a
<br />
covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties
<br />
receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify
<br />
or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license
<br />
you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered
<br />
work and works based on it.
<br />
<br /><br />
  A patent license is "discriminatory" if it does not include within
<br />
the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is
<br />
conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are
<br />
specifically granted under this License.  You may not convey a covered
<br />
work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is
<br />
in the business of distributing software, under which you make payment
<br />
to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying
<br />
the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the
<br />
parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory
<br />
patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work
<br />
conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily
<br />
for and in connection with specific products or compilations that
<br />
contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,
<br />
or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.
<br />
<br /><br />
  Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting
<br />
any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may
<br />
otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.
<br />
<br /><br />
  12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.
<br />
<br /><br />
  If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
<br />
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
<br />
excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot convey a
<br />
covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
<br />
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may
<br />
not convey it at all.  For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you
<br />
to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey
<br />
the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this
<br />
License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.
<br />
<br /><br />
  13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.
<br />
<br /><br />
  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have
<br />
permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed
<br />
under version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single
<br />
combined work, and to convey the resulting work.  The terms of this
<br />
License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,
<br />
but the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License,
<br />
section 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the
<br />
combination as such.
<br />
<br /><br />
  14. Revised Versions of this License.
<br />
<br /><br />
  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of
<br />
the GNU General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will
<br />
be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
<br />
address new problems or concerns.
<br />
<br /><br />
  Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the
<br />
Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General
<br />
Public License "or any later version" applies to it, you have the
<br />
option of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered
<br />
version or of any later version published by the Free Software
<br />
Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of the
<br />
GNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published
<br />
by the Free Software Foundation.
<br />
<br /><br />
  If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future
<br />
versions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy's
<br />
public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you
<br />
to choose that version for the Program.
<br />
<br /><br />
  Later license versions may give you additional or different
<br />
permissions.  However, no additional obligations are imposed on any
<br />
author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a
<br />
later version.
<br />
<br /><br />
  15. Disclaimer of Warranty.
<br />
<br /><br />
  THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY
<br />
APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT
<br />
HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY
<br />
OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,
<br />
THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
<br />
PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM
<br />
IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF
<br />
ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
<br />
<br /><br />
  16. Limitation of Liability.
<br />
<br /><br />
  IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
<br />
WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS
<br />
THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY
<br />
GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE
<br />
USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF
<br />
DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD
<br />
PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS),
<br />
EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF
<br />
SUCH DAMAGES.
<br />
<br /><br />
  17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.
<br />
<br /><br />
  If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided
<br />
above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,
<br />
reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates
<br />
an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the
<br />
Program, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a
<br />
copy of the Program in return for a fee.
<br />
<br /><br />
                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
<br />
<br /><br />
            How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs
<br />
<br /><br />
  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
<br />
possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
<br />
free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.
<br />
<br /><br />
  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest
<br />
to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
<br />
state the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
<br />
the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.
<br />
<br /><br />
    <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>
<br />
    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>
<br />
<br /><br />
    This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify
<br />
    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
<br />
    the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or
<br />
    (at your option) any later version.
<br />
<br /><br />
    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
<br />
    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
<br />
    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the
<br />
    GNU General Public License for more details.
<br />
<br /><br />
    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
<br />
    along with this program.  If not, see <http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.
<br />
<br /><br />
Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.
<br />
<br /><br />
  If the program does terminal interaction, make it output a short
<br />
notice like this when it starts in an interactive mode:
<br />
<br /><br />
    <program>  Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>
<br />
    This program comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.
<br />
    This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it
<br />
    under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.
<br />
<br /><br />
The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate
<br />
parts of the General Public License.  Of course, your program's commands
<br />
might be different; for a GUI interface, you would use an "about box".
<br />
<br /><br />
  You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school,
<br />
if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if necessary.
<br />
For more information on this, and how to apply and follow the GNU GPL, see
<br />
<http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.
<br />
<br /><br />
  The GNU General Public License does not permit incorporating your program
<br />
into proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you
<br />
may consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with
<br />
the library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General
<br />
Public License instead of this License.  But first, please read
<br />

<br />
 #  A large portion of the dictionary entries
<br />
 #  originate from ICOT Free Software.  The following conditions for ICOT
<br />
 #  Free Software applies to the current dictionary as well.
<br />
 #
<br />
 #  Each User may also freely distribute the Program, whether in its
<br />
 #  original form or modified, to any third party or parties, PROVIDED
<br />
 #  that the provisions of Section 3 ("NO WARRANTY") will ALWAYS appear
<br />
 #  on, or be attached to, the Program, which is distributed substantially
<br />
 #  in the same form as set out herein and that such intended
<br />
 #  distribution, if actually made, will neither violate or otherwise
<br />
 #  contravene any of the laws and regulations of the countries having
<br />
 #  jurisdiction over the User or the intended distribution itself.
<br />
 #
<br />
 #  NO WARRANTY
<br />
 #
<br />
 #  The program was produced on an experimental basis in the course of the
<br />
 #  research and development conducted during the project and is provided
<br />
 #  to users as so produced on an experimental basis.  Accordingly, the
<br />
 #  program is provided without any warranty whatsoever, whether express,
<br />
 #  implied, statutory or otherwise.  The term "warranty" used herein
<br />
 #  includes, but is not limited to, any warranty of the quality,
<br />
 #  performance, merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose of
<br />
 #  the program and the nonexistence of any infringement or violation of
<br />
 #  any right of any third party.
<br />
 #
<br />
 #  Each user of the program will agree and understand, and be deemed to
<br />
 #  have agreed and understood, that there is no warranty whatsoever for
<br />
 #  the program and, accordingly, the entire risk arising from or
<br />
 #  otherwise connected with the program is assumed by the user.
<br />
 #
<br />
 #  Therefore, neither ICOT, the copyright holder, or any other
<br />

<br />
 #  and consequential damages, arising out of or otherwise in connection
<br />
 #  with the use or inability to use the program or any product, material
<br />
 #  or result produced or otherwise obtained by using the program,
<br />
 #  regardless of whether they have been advised of, or otherwise had
<br />
 #  knowledge of, the possibility of such damages at any time during the
<br />
 #  project or thereafter.  Each user will be deemed to have agreed to the
<br />
 #  foregoing by his or her commencement of use of the program.  The term
<br />
 #  "use" as used herein includes, but is not limited to, the use,
<br />
 #  modification, copying and distribution of the program and the
<br />
 #  production of secondary products from the program.
<br />
 #
<br />
 #  In the case where the program, whether in its original form or
<br />
 #  modified, was distributed or delivered to or received by a user from
<br />
 #  any person, organization or entity other than ICOT, unless it makes or
<br />
 #  grants independently of ICOT any specific warranty to the user in
<br />
 #  writing, such person, organization or entity, will also be exempted
<br />
 #  from and not be held liable to the user for any such damages as noted
<br />
 #  above as far as the program is concerned.

5. Time Zone Database
<br />
<br /><br />
  ICU uses the public domain data and code derived from Time Zone
<br />
Database for its time zone support. The ownership of the TZ database
<br />
is explained in BCP 175: Procedure for Maintaining the Time Zone
<br />
Database section 7.
<br />
<br /><br />
 # 7.  Database Ownership
<br />
 #
<br />
 #    The TZ database itself is not an IETF Contribution or an IETF
<br />
 #    document.  Rather it is a pre-existing and regularly updated work
<br />
 #    that is in the public domain, and is intended to remain in the
<br />
 #    public domain.  Therefore, BCPs 78 [RFC5378] and 79 [RFC3979] do
<br />
 #    not apply to the TZ Database or contributions that individuals make
<br />
 #    to it.  Should any claims be made and substantiated against the TZ
<br />
 #    Database, the organization that is providing the IANA
<br />
 #    Considerations defined in this RFC, under the memorandum of
<br />
 #    understanding with the IETF, currently ICANN, may act in accordance
<br />
 #    with all competent court orders.  No ownership claims will be made
<br />
 #    by ICANN or the IETF Trust on the database or the code.  Any person
<br />
 #    making a contribution to the database or code waives all rights to
<br />
 #    future claims in that contribution or in the TZ Database.

                    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
<br />
                       Version 3, 29 June 2007
<br />
<br /><br />
 Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <http://fsf.org/>
<br />
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
<br />
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
<br />
<br /><br />
                            Preamble
<br />
<br /><br />
  The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for
<br />
software and other kinds of works.
<br />
<br /><br />
  The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed
<br />
to take away your freedom to share and change the works.  By contrast,
<br />
the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to
<br />
share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free
<br />
software for all its users.  We, the Free Software Foundation, use the
<br />
GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to
<br />
any other work released this way by its authors.  You can apply it to
<br />
your programs, too.
<br />
<br /><br />
  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
<br />
price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
<br />
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
<br />
them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you
<br />
want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new
<br />
free programs, and that you know you can do these things.
<br />
<br /><br />
  To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you
<br />
these rights or asking you to surrender the rights.  Therefore, you have
<br />
certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if
<br />
you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.
<br />
<br /><br />
  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
<br />
gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same
<br />
freedoms that you received.  You must make sure that they, too, receive
<br />
or can get the source code.  And you must show them these terms so they
<br />
know their rights.
<br />
<br /><br />
  Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:
<br />
(1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License
<br />
giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.
<br />
<br /><br />
  For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains
<br />
that there is no warranty for this free software.  For both users' and
<br />
authors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as
<br />
changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to
<br />
authors of previous versions.
<br />
<br /><br />
  Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run
<br />
modified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer
<br />
can do so.  This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of
<br />
protecting users' freedom to change the software.  The systematic
<br />
pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to
<br />
use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable.  Therefore, we
<br />
have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those
<br />
products.  If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we
<br />
stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions
<br />
of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.
<br />
<br /><br />
  Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.
<br />
States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of
<br />
software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to
<br />
avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could
<br />
make it effectively proprietary.  To prevent this, the GPL assures that
<br />
patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.
<br />
<br /><br />
  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
<br />
modification follow.
<br />
<br /><br />
                       TERMS AND CONDITIONS
<br />
<br /><br />
  0. Definitions.
<br />
<br /><br />
  "This License" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.
<br />
<br /><br />
  "Copyright" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of
<br />
works, such as semiconductor masks.
<br />
<br /><br />
  "The Program" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this
<br />
License.  Each licensee is addressed as "you".  "Licensees" and
<br />
"recipients" may be individuals or organizations.
<br />
<br /><br />
  To "modify" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work
<br />
in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an
<br />
exact copy.  The resulting work is called a "modified version" of the
<br />
earlier work or a work "based on" the earlier work.
<br />
<br /><br />
  A "covered work" means either the unmodified Program or a work based
<br />
on the Program.
<br />
<br /><br />
  To "propagate" a work means to do anything with it that, without
<br />
permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for
<br />
infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a
<br />
computer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes copying,
<br />
distribution (with or without modification), making available to the
<br />
public, and in some countries other activities as well.
<br />
<br /><br />
  To "convey" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other
<br />
parties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user through
<br />
a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.
<br />
<br /><br />
  An interactive user interface displays "Appropriate Legal Notices"
<br />
to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible
<br />
feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)
<br />
tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the
<br />
extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the
<br />
work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.  If
<br />
the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a
<br />
menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.
<br />
<br /><br />
  1. Source Code.
<br />
<br /><br />
  The "source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work
<br />
for making modifications to it.  "Object code" means any non-source
<br />
form of a work.
<br />
<br /><br />
  A "Standard Interface" means an interface that either is an official
<br />
standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of
<br />
interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that
<br />
is widely used among developers working in that language.
<br />
<br /><br />
  The "System Libraries" of an executable work include anything, other
<br />
than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of
<br />
packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major
<br />
Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that
<br />
Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an
<br />
implementation is available to the public in source code form.  A
<br />
"Major Component", in this context, means a major essential component
<br />
(kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system
<br />
(if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to
<br />
produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.
<br />
<br /><br />
  The "Corresponding Source" for a work in object code form means all
<br />
the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable
<br />
work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to
<br />
control those activities.  However, it does not include the work's
<br />
System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free
<br />
programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but
<br />
which are not part of the work.  For example, Corresponding Source
<br />
includes interface definition files associated with source files for
<br />
the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically
<br />
linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,
<br />
such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those
<br />
subprograms and other parts of the work.
<br />
<br /><br />
  The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users
<br />
can regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding
<br />
Source.
<br />
<br /><br />
  The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that
<br />
same work.
<br />
<br /><br />
  2. Basic Permissions.
<br />
<br /><br />
  All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of
<br />
copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated
<br />
conditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited
<br />
permission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running a
<br />
covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its
<br />
content, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges your
<br />
rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.
<br />
<br /><br />
  You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not
<br />
convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains
<br />
in force.  You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose
<br />
of having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you
<br />
with facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with
<br />
the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do
<br />
not control copyright.  Those thus making or running the covered works
<br />
for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction
<br />
and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of
<br />
your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.
<br />
<br /><br />
  Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under
<br />
the conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10
<br />
makes it unnecessary.
<br />
<br /><br />
  3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.
<br />
<br /><br />
  No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological
<br />
measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article
<br />
11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or
<br />
similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such
<br />
measures.
<br />
<br /><br />
  When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid
<br />
circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention
<br />
is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to
<br />
the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or
<br />
modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's
<br />
users, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of
<br />
technological measures.
<br />
<br /><br />
  4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.
<br />
<br /><br />
  You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you
<br />
receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and
<br />
appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;
<br />
keep intact all notices stating that this License and any
<br />
non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;
<br />
keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all
<br />
recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.
<br />
<br /><br />
  You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,
<br />
and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.
<br />
<br /><br />
  5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.
<br />
<br /><br />
  You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to
<br />
produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the
<br />
terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:
<br />
<br /><br />
    a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified
<br />
    it, and giving a relevant date.
<br />
<br /><br />
    b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is
<br />
    released under this License and any conditions added under section
<br />
    7.  This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to
<br />
    "keep intact all notices".
<br />
<br /><br />
    c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this
<br />
    License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This
<br />
    License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7
<br />
    additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,
<br />
    regardless of how they are packaged.  This License gives no
<br />
    permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not
<br />
    invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.
<br />
<br /><br />
    d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display
<br />
    Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive
<br />
    interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your
<br />
    work need not make them do so.
<br />
<br /><br />
  A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent
<br />
works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,
<br />
and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,
<br />
in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an
<br />
"aggregate" if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not
<br />
used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users
<br />
beyond what the individual works permit.  Inclusion of a covered work
<br />
in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other
<br />
parts of the aggregate.
<br />
<br /><br />
  6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.
<br />
<br /><br />
  You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms
<br />
of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the
<br />
machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,
<br />
in one of these ways:
<br />
<br /><br />
    a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
<br />
    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the
<br />
    Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium
<br />
    customarily used for software interchange.
<br />
<br /><br />
    b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
<br />
    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a
<br />
    written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as
<br />
    long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product
<br />
    model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a
<br />
    copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the
<br />
    product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical
<br />
    medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no
<br />
    more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this
<br />
    conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the
<br />
    Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.
<br />
<br /><br />
    c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the
<br />
    written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This
<br />
    alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and
<br />
    only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord
<br />
    with subsection 6b.
<br />
<br /><br />
    d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated
<br />
    place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the
<br />
    Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no
<br />
    further charge.  You need not require recipients to copy the
<br />
    Corresponding Source along with the object code.  If the place to
<br />
    copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source
<br />
    may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)
<br />
    that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain
<br />
    clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the
<br />
    Corresponding Source.  Regardless of what server hosts the
<br />
    Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is
<br />
    available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.
<br />
<br /><br />
    e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided
<br />
    you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding
<br />
    Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no
<br />
    charge under subsection 6d.
<br />
<br /><br />
  A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded
<br />
from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be
<br />
included in conveying the object code work.
<br />
<br /><br />
  A "User Product" is either (1) a "consumer product", which means any
<br />
tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,
<br />
or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation
<br />
into a dwelling.  In determining whether a product is a consumer product,
<br />
doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.  For a particular
<br />
product received by a particular user, "normally used" refers to a
<br />
typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status
<br />
of the particular user or of the way in which the particular user
<br />
actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product.  A product
<br />
is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial
<br />
commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent
<br />
the only significant mode of use of the product.
<br />
<br /><br />
  "Installation Information" for a User Product means any methods,
<br />
procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install
<br />
and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from
<br />
a modified version of its Corresponding Source.  The information must
<br />
suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object
<br />
code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because
<br />
modification has been made.
<br />
<br /><br />
  If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or
<br />
specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as
<br />
part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the
<br />
User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a
<br />
fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the
<br />
Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied
<br />
by the Installation Information.  But this requirement does not apply
<br />
if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install
<br />
modified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has
<br />
been installed in ROM).
<br />
<br /><br />
  The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a
<br />
requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates
<br />
for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for
<br />
the User Product in which it has been modified or installed.  Access to a
<br />
network may be denied when the modification itself materially and
<br />
adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and
<br />
protocols for communication across the network.
<br />
<br /><br />
  Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,
<br />
in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly
<br />
documented (and with an implementation available to the public in
<br />
source code form), and must require no special password or key for
<br />
unpacking, reading or copying.
<br />
<br /><br />
  7. Additional Terms.
<br />
<br /><br />
  "Additional permissions" are terms that supplement the terms of this
<br />
License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.
<br />
Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall
<br />
be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent
<br />
that they are valid under applicable law.  If additional permissions
<br />
apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately
<br />
under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by
<br />
this License without regard to the additional permissions.
<br />
<br /><br />
  When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option
<br />
remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of
<br />
it.  (Additional permissions may be written to require their own
<br />
removal in certain cases when you modify the work.)  You may place
<br />
additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,
<br />
for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.
<br />
<br /><br />
  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you
<br />
add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of
<br />
that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:
<br />
<br /><br />
    a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the
<br />
    terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or
<br />
<br /><br />
    b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or
<br />
    author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal
<br />
    Notices displayed by works containing it; or
<br />
<br /><br />
    c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or
<br />
    requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in
<br />
    reasonable ways as different from the original version; or
<br />
<br /><br />
    d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or
<br />
    authors of the material; or
<br />
<br /><br />
    e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some
<br />
    trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or
<br />
<br /><br />
    f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that
<br />
    material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of
<br />
    it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for
<br />
    any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on
<br />
    those licensors and authors.
<br />
<br /><br />
  All other non-permissive additional terms are considered "further
<br />
restrictions" within the meaning of section 10.  If the Program as you
<br />
received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is
<br />
governed by this License along with a term that is a further
<br />
restriction, you may remove that term.  If a license document contains
<br />
a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this
<br />
License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms
<br />
of that license document, provided that the further restriction does
<br />
not survive such relicensing or conveying.
<br />
<br /><br />
  If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you
<br />
must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the
<br />
additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating
<br />
where to find the applicable terms.
<br />
<br /><br />
  Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the
<br />
form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;
<br />
the above requirements apply either way.
<br />
<br /><br />
  8. Termination.
<br />
<br /><br />
  You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly
<br />
provided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or
<br />
modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under
<br />
this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third
<br />
paragraph of section 11).
<br />
<br /><br />
  However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your
<br />
license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)
<br />
provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and
<br />
finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright
<br />
holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means
<br />
prior to 60 days after the cessation.
<br />
<br /><br />
  Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is
<br />
reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the
<br />
violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have
<br />
received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that
<br />
copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after
<br />
your receipt of the notice.
<br />
<br /><br />
  Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the
<br />
licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under
<br />
this License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently
<br />
reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same
<br />
material under section 10.
<br />
<br /><br />
  9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.
<br />
<br /><br />
  You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or
<br />
run a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work
<br />
occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission
<br />
to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.  However,
<br />
nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or
<br />
modify any covered work.  These actions infringe copyright if you do
<br />
not accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or propagating a
<br />
covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.
<br />
<br /><br />
  10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.
<br />
<br /><br />
  Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically
<br />
receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and
<br />
propagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not responsible
<br />
for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.
<br />
<br /><br />
  An "entity transaction" is a transaction transferring control of an
<br />
organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an
<br />
organization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a covered
<br />
work results from an entity transaction, each party to that
<br />
transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever
<br />
licenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could
<br />
give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the
<br />
Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if
<br />
the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.
<br />
<br /><br />
  You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the
<br />
rights granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you may
<br />
not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of
<br />
rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation
<br />
(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that
<br />
any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for
<br />
sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.
<br />
<br /><br />
  11. Patents.
<br />
<br /><br />
  A "contributor" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this
<br />
License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.  The
<br />
work thus licensed is called the contributor's "contributor version".
<br />
<br /><br />
  A contributor's "essential patent claims" are all patent claims
<br />
owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or
<br />
hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted
<br />
by this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,
<br />
but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a
<br />
consequence of further modification of the contributor version.  For
<br />
purposes of this definition, "control" includes the right to grant
<br />
patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of
<br />
this License.
<br />
<br /><br />
  Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free
<br />
patent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to
<br />
make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and
<br />
propagate the contents of its contributor version.
<br />
<br /><br />
  In the following three paragraphs, a "patent license" is any express
<br />
agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent
<br />
(such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to
<br />
sue for patent infringement).  To "grant" such a patent license to a
<br />
party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a
<br />
patent against the party.
<br />
<br /><br />
  If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,
<br />
and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone
<br />
to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a
<br />
publicly available network server or other readily accessible means,
<br />
then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so
<br />
available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the
<br />
patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner
<br />
consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent
<br />
license to downstream recipients.  "Knowingly relying" means you have
<br />
actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the
<br />
covered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work
<br />
in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that
<br />
country that you have reason to believe are valid.
<br />
<br /><br />
  If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or
<br />
arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a
<br />
covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties
<br />
receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify
<br />
or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license
<br />
you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered
<br />
work and works based on it.
<br />
<br /><br />
  A patent license is "discriminatory" if it does not include within
<br />
the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is
<br />
conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are
<br />
specifically granted under this License.  You may not convey a covered
<br />
work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is
<br />
in the business of distributing software, under which you make payment
<br />
to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying
<br />
the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the
<br />
parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory
<br />
patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work
<br />
conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily
<br />
for and in connection with specific products or compilations that
<br />
contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,
<br />
or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.
<br />
<br /><br />
  Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting
<br />
any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may
<br />
otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.
<br />
<br /><br />
  12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.
<br />
<br /><br />
  If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
<br />
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
<br />
excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot convey a
<br />
covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
<br />
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may
<br />
not convey it at all.  For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you
<br />
to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey
<br />
the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this
<br />
License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.
<br />
<br /><br />
  13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.
<br />
<br /><br />
  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have
<br />
permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed
<br />
under version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single
<br />
combined work, and to convey the resulting work.  The terms of this
<br />
License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,
<br />
but the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License,
<br />
section 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the
<br />
combination as such.
<br />
<br /><br />
  14. Revised Versions of this License.
<br />
<br /><br />
  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of
<br />
the GNU General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will
<br />
be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
<br />
address new problems or concerns.
<br />
<br /><br />
  Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the
<br />
Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General
<br />
Public License "or any later version" applies to it, you have the
<br />
option of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered
<br />
version or of any later version published by the Free Software
<br />
Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of the
<br />
GNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published
<br />
by the Free Software Foundation.
<br />
<br /><br />
  If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future
<br />
versions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy's
<br />
public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you
<br />
to choose that version for the Program.
<br />
<br /><br />
  Later license versions may give you additional or different
<br />
permissions.  However, no additional obligations are imposed on any
<br />
author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a
<br />
later version.
<br />
<br /><br />
  15. Disclaimer of Warranty.
<br />
<br /><br />
  THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY
<br />
APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT
<br />
HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY
<br />
OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,
<br />
THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
<br />
PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM
<br />
IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF
<br />
ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
<br />
<br /><br />
  16. Limitation of Liability.
<br />
<br /><br />
  IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
<br />
WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS
<br />
THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY
<br />
GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE
<br />
USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF
<br />
DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD
<br />
PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS),
<br />
EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF
<br />
SUCH DAMAGES.
<br />
<br /><br />
  17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.
<br />
<br /><br />
  If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided
<br />
above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,
<br />
reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates
<br />
an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the
<br />
Program, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a
<br />
copy of the Program in return for a fee.
<br />
<br /><br />
                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
<br />
<br /><br />
            How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs
<br />
<br /><br />
  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
<br />
possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
<br />
free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.
<br />
<br /><br />
  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest
<br />
to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
<br />
state the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
<br />
the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.
<br />
<br /><br />
    <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>
<br />
    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>
<br />
<br /><br />
    This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify
<br />
    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
<br />
    the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or
<br />
    (at your option) any later version.
<br />
<br /><br />
    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
<br />
    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
<br />
    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the
<br />
    GNU General Public License for more details.
<br />
<br /><br />
    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
<br />
    along with this program.  If not, see <http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.
<br />
<br /><br />
Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.
<br />
<br /><br />
  If the program does terminal interaction, make it output a short
<br />
notice like this when it starts in an interactive mode:
<br />
<br /><br />
    <program>  Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>
<br />
    This program comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.
<br />
    This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it
<br />
    under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.
<br />
<br /><br />
The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate
<br />
parts of the General Public License.  Of course, your program's commands
<br />
might be different; for a GUI interface, you would use an "about box".
<br />
<br /><br />
  You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school,
<br />
if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if necessary.
<br />
For more information on this, and how to apply and follow the GNU GPL, see
<br />
<http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.
<br />
<br /><br />
  The GNU General Public License does not permit incorporating your program
<br />
into proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you
<br />
may consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with
<br />
the library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General
<br />
Public License instead of this License.  But first, please read

   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION
<br />
<br /><br />
   1. Definitions.
<br />
<br /><br />
      "License" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,
<br />
      and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.
<br />
<br /><br />
      "Licensor" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by
<br />
      the copyright owner that is granting the License.
<br />
<br /><br />
      "Legal Entity" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all
<br />
      other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
<br />
      control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,
<br />
      "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
<br />
      direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
<br />
      otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
<br />
      outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.
<br />
<br /><br />
      "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
<br />
      exercising permissions granted by this License.
<br />
<br /><br />
      "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
<br />
      including but not limited to software source code, documentation
<br />
      source, and configuration files.
<br />
<br /><br />
      "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
<br />
      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
<br />
      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
<br />
      and conversions to other media types.
<br />
<br /><br />
      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
<br />
      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
<br />
      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
<br />
      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).
<br />
<br /><br />
      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
<br />
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
<br />
      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
<br />
      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
<br />
      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
<br />
      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
<br />
      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
<br />
<br /><br />
      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
<br />
      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
<br />
      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
<br />
      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
<br />
      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
<br />
      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
<br />
      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
<br />
      to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
<br />
      communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
<br />
      and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
<br />
      Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
<br />
      excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
<br />
      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."
<br />
<br /><br />
      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
<br />
      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
<br />
      subsequently incorporated within the Work.
<br />
<br /><br />
   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
<br />
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
<br />
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
<br />
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
<br />
      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
<br />
      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
<br />
<br /><br />
   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
<br />
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
<br />
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
<br />
      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
<br />
      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
<br />
      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
<br />
      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
<br />
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
<br />
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
<br />
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
<br />
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
<br />
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
<br />
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
<br />
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
<br />
      as of the date such litigation is filed.
<br />
<br /><br />
   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
<br />
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
<br />
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
<br />
      meet the following conditions:
<br />
<br /><br />
      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
<br />
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
<br />
<br /><br />
      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
<br />
          stating that You changed the files; and
<br />
<br /><br />
      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
<br />
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
<br />
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
<br />
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
<br />
          the Derivative Works; and
<br />
<br /><br />
      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
<br />
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
<br />
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
<br />
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
<br />
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
<br />
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
<br />
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
<br />
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
<br />
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
<br />
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
<br />
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
<br />
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
<br />
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
<br />
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
<br />
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
<br />
          as modifying the License.
<br />
<br /><br />
      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
<br />
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
<br />
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
<br />
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
<br />
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
<br />
      the conditions stated in this License.
<br />
<br /><br />
   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
<br />
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
<br />
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
<br />
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
<br />
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
<br />
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
<br />
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
<br />
<br /><br />
   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
<br />
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
<br />
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
<br />
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
<br />
<br /><br />
   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
<br />
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
<br />
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
<br />
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
<br />
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
<br />
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
<br />
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
<br />
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
<br />
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
<br />
<br /><br />
   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
<br />
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
<br />
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
<br />
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
<br />
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
<br />
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
<br />
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
<br />
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
<br />
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
<br />
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
<br />
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
<br />
<br /><br />
   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
<br />
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
<br />
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
<br />
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
<br />
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
<br />
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
<br />
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
<br />
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
<br />
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
<br />
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
<br />
<br /><br />
   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
<br />
<br /><br />
   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.
<br />
<br /><br />
      To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following
<br />
      boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets "[]"
<br />
      replaced with your own identifying information. (Don't include
<br />
      the brackets!)  The text should be enclosed in the appropriate
<br />
      comment syntax for the file format. We also recommend that a
<br />

<br />
A. HISTORY OF THE SOFTWARE
<br />
==========================
<br />
Python was created in the early 1990s by Guido van Rossum at Stichting
<br />
Mathematisch Centrum (CWI, see http://www.cwi.nl) in the Netherlands
<br />
as a successor of a language called ABC.  Guido remains Python's
<br />
principal author, although it includes many contributions from others.
<br />
<br /><br />
In 1995, Guido continued his work on Python at the Corporation for
<br />
National Research Initiatives (CNRI, see http://www.cnri.reston.va.us)
<br />
in Reston, Virginia where he released several versions of the
<br />
software.
<br />
<br /><br />
In May 2000, Guido and the Python core development team moved to
<br />
BeOpen.com to form the BeOpen PythonLabs team.  In October of the same
<br />
year, the PythonLabs team moved to Digital Creations (now Zope
<br />
Corporation, see http://www.zope.com).  In 2001, the Python Software
<br />
Foundation (PSF, see http://www.python.org/psf/) was formed, a
<br />
non-profit organization created specifically to own Python-related
<br />
Intellectual Property.  Zope Corporation is a sponsoring member of
<br />
the PSF.
<br />
<br /><br />
All Python releases are Open Source (see http://www.opensource.org for
<br />
the Open Source Definition).  Historically, most, but not all, Python
<br />
releases have also been GPL-compatible; the table below summarizes
<br />
the various releases.
<br />
<br /><br />
    Release            Derived           Year           Owner           GPL-
<br />

<br />
<br /><br />
    0.9.0 thru 1.2                      1991-1995       CWI             yes
<br />
    1.3 thru 1.5.2     1.2              1995-1999       CNRI            yes
<br />

<br />

<br />
    2.1                2.0+1.6.1        2001            PSF             no
<br />

<br />
    2.1.1              2.1+2.0.1        2001            PSF             yes
<br />
    2.1.2              2.1.1            2002            PSF             yes
<br />
    2.1.3              2.1.2            2002            PSF             yes
<br />
    2.2 and above      2.1.1            2001-now        PSF             yes
<br />
<br /><br />
Footnotes:
<br />
<br /><br />
(1) GPL-compatible doesn't mean that we're distributing Python under
<br />
    the GPL.  All Python licenses, unlike the GPL, let you distribute
<br />
    a modified version without making your changes open source.  The
<br />
    GPL-compatible licenses make it possible to combine Python with
<br />
    other software that is released under the GPL; the others don't.
<br />
<br /><br />
(2) According to Richard Stallman, 1.6.1 is not GPL-compatible,
<br />
    because its license has a choice of law clause.  According to
<br />
    CNRI, however, Stallman's lawyer has told CNRI's lawyer that 1.6.1
<br />
    is "not incompatible" with the GPL.
<br />
<br /><br />
Thanks to the many outside volunteers who have worked under Guido's
<br />
direction to make these releases possible.

8.	APPLICABLE LAW.
<br />
a.	United States. If you acquired the software in the United States, Washington state law governs the interpretation of this agreement and applies to claims for breach of it, regardless of conflict of laws principles.

<br />
10.	DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY. The software is licensed "as-is." You bear the risk of using it. Microsoft gives no express warranties, guarantees or conditions. You may have additional consumer rights or statutory guarantees under your local laws which this agreement cannot change.

<br />
It also applies even if Microsoft knew or should have known about the possibility of the damages. The above limitation or exclusion may not apply to you because your country may not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental, consequential or other damages.

<br />
Remarque : Ce logiciel étant distribué au Québec, Canada, certaines des clauses dans ce contrat sont fournies ci-dessous en français.

Elle s’applique également, même si Microsoft connaissait ou devrait connaître l’éventualité d’un tel dommage. Si votre pays n’autorise pas l’exclusion ou la limitation de responsabilité pour les dommages indirects, accessoires ou de quelque nature que ce soit, il se peut que la limitation ou l’exclusion ci-dessus ne s’appliquera pas à votre égard.
<br />
EFFET JURIDIQUE. Le présent contrat décrit certains droits juridiques. Vous pourriez avoir d’autres droits prévus par les lois de votre pays. Le présent contrat ne modifie pas les droits que vous confèrent les lois de votre pays si celles-ci ne le permettent pas.

MiniZip - Copyright (c) 1998-2010 - by Gilles Vollant - version 1.1 64 bits from Mathias Svensson
<br />
<br /><br />
Introduction
<br />
---------------------
<br />
MiniZip 1.1 is built from MiniZip 1.0 by Gilles Vollant ( http://www.winimage.com/zLibDll/minizip.html )
<br />
<br /><br />
When adding ZIP64 support into minizip it would result into risk of breaking compatibility with minizip 1.0.
<br />
All possible work was done for compatibility.
<br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Background
<br />
---------------------
<br />
When adding ZIP64 support Mathias Svensson found that Even Rouault have added ZIP64 
<br />
support for unzip.c into minizip for a open source project called gdal ( http://www.gdal.org/ )
<br />
<br /><br />
That was used as a starting point. And after that ZIP64 support was added to zip.c
<br />
some refactoring and code cleanup was also done.
<br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Changed from MiniZip 1.0 to MiniZip 1.1
<br />
---------------------------------------
<br />
* Added ZIP64 support for unzip ( by Even Rouault )
<br />
* Added ZIP64 support for zip ( by Mathias Svensson )
<br />
* Reverted some changed that Even Rouault did.
<br />
* Bunch of patches received from Gulles Vollant that he received for MiniZip from various users.
<br />
* Added unzip patch for BZIP Compression method (patch create by Daniel Borca)
<br />
* Added BZIP Compress method for zip
<br />
* Did some refactoring and code cleanup
<br />

<br />
1.4	If Customer does not accept these Terms and Conditions, he shall not install, use or reproduce the Licenced Rights and return them to ZMT. Furthermore, Customer shall cease any and all attempts to download, install, use or reproduce any of the Licenced Rights and delete any and all Licenced Rights downloaded or installed.
<br />
1.5	The Licenced Rights are protected by copyright.
<br />
<br /><br />
2.	Grant of the Licence
<br />

Enthought Python Distribution
<br />
Software License and Subscription Service Agreement
<br />
<br /><br />
This Enthought Python Distribution Software License and Service Subscription Agreement (the "Agreement") is between Enthought, Inc., a Delaware corporation ("Enthought"), and the licensee and subscriber of EPD and Subscription Services, respectively, who accepts the terms of this Agreement (the "Customer").  The effective date of this Agreement (the "Effective Date") is the earlier of the date Customer accepts this Agreement or the first date the Customer uses the Software or Subscription Services.  Please read this Agreement carefully before using the Software or Subscription Services from Enthought.  By using the Software or Subscription Services Customer signifies its assent to and acceptance of the terms of this Agreement.  If the Customer does not accept the terms of this Agreement, then it must not use the Software or Subscription Services.
<br />
<br /><br />
1. Definitions.  The following terms, when capitalized, are defined as follows:
<br />
<br /><br />
  A. "Third Party Software" shall mean any and all third party software and related intellectual property, whether proprietary or open source, that are subscribed for as part of the Subscription Services by Customer and distributed by Enthought under this Agreement.
<br />
<br /><br />
  B. "Enthought Python Distribution" or "EPD" or "Software" shall mean Enthought's proprietary software and related intellectual property that packages Third Party Software in a single binary form and performs installation services of EPD and Third Party Software by the Customer.
<br />
<br /><br />
  C. "Subscription Services" shall mean annual subscription by Customer for (i) Third Party Software distributed by Enthought and (ii) support services provided by Enthought for EPD at the service level subscribed to by Customer.
<br />
<br /><br />
  D. "Initial Term" shall mean the period from the Effective Date through the date that is the one year anniversary for such date.
<br />
<br /><br />
  E. "Renewal Term" shall be any additional one-year terms (each, a "Renewal Term") from the end of the Initial Term or any subsequent Renewal Term.
<br />
<br /><br />
  F. "User" shall mean a single individual authorized per the terms, conditions and restrictions herein, to use the Software.
<br />
<br /><br />
Other capitalized terms used in this Agreement are defined in the context in which they are used and shall have the meanings indicated by such use.
<br />
<br /><br />
2. EPD Software License
<br />
<br /><br />
Commencing on the Effective Date, Enthought grants Customer a limited, non-exclusive right to use EPD, but only pursuant to the terms and conditions of this Agreement.  The specific use rights granted to Customer are as follows:
<br />
<br /><br />
  A. "User License".  Each User License grants Customer the right for one (1) User to install and use EPD on as many computers or workstations as may be required for the User's individual use of EPD.  A separate User License is required for each User of EPD in the event multiple Users use EPD on a single computer or workstation.  Use of EPD on a cluster, where the User is making parallel use of more than two (2) nodes requires a separate license.   Customer may make as many copies of EPD as are reasonably required for normal computer backup and archival purposes.   All copies must contain all title, trademark, and copyright information and restricted rights notices as are provided in EPD.  Customer shall not remove or obscure any such notices.  The Enthought quotation shall set forth the quantity of the User Licenses ordered by Customer.  Unless otherwise indicated on the quotation, prices exclude any applicable sales, value added, or similar tax payable by Customer.
<br />
<br /><br />
  B. Customer shall not distribute EPD to third parties and will only authorize the use of EPD to properly licensed Users as required under the terms of this Agreement.  Additionally, Customer shall not distribute to third parties, as standalone software or as a component of a Customer application, any Third Party Software obtained by Customer under this Agreement unless such third parties have a User License in effect at the time of such distribution.  The Customer represents and warrants to Enthought that Customer and all of its authorized Users will comply at all times with all applicable laws and regulations in using EPD.  If Customer or any of its authorized Users use EPD in an unlawful manner, for unlawful purposes or in any way that does not comply with all applicable laws and regulations, then the license may be revoked by Enthought and, in such event, Customer and its authorized Users will cease using EPD and, at Enthought's discretion, will uninstall EPD and either return to Enthought or destroy all copies of EPD.  The provisions of this Section 2b shall survive any termination or expiration of this Agreement.
<br />
<br /><br />
  C. "Academic License".  For Customers using EPD for education or research in a degree-granting institution, the license agreement controlling the usage of EPD can be found at following location:   http://www.enthought.com/EPDAcademicTerms.html
<br />
<br /><br />
3. Subscription Services
<br />
<br /><br />
Enthought shall deliver to Customer the Subscription Services ordered by Customer in consideration for the annual Subscription Services fees as specified in the Enthought quotation, plus any applicable taxes, levies, duties, assessments and custom fees (collectively, the "Annual Subscription Fee").  The initial Annual Subscription Fees shall be due and payable prior to delivery of the Software, unless other payment terms are specified in the Enthought quotation.  Customer may renew its order for Subscription Services for additional one-year Renewal Terms upon payment of the then current Annual Subscription Fee prior to the expiration of the Initial Term or any subsequent Renewal Term.  The following services shall be provided to Customer in consideration for the Annual Subscription Fee for the Initial Term and each Renewal Term:
<br />
<br /><br />
  A. Third Party Software Distribution
<br />
    Enthought will distribute to Customer, along with periodic updates if and when available, Third Party Software.  A list of Third Party Software distributed to Customer pursuant to the Subscription Services and copies of the source code for such is available through links published on the Enthought website.

    (ii) Subject to license agreements for each Third Party Software, a copy of the licenses which are located in the Third Party Software source code and permits Customer to run, copy, modify and redistribute (subject to certain obligations in some cases) the source code.
<br />
    Enthought reserves the right to change the Third Party Software that is distributed at any time.
<br />
<br /><br />
  B. Support Services Subscription
<br />
    Upon receipt of full payment for Subscription Services, Enthought will deliver to Customer support services at the service level ordered and paid for by the Customer.  The service level ordered by Customer shall be specified in the Enthought quotation.  Customer may change its service level at the time of renewal by providing written notification to Enthought requesting a service level change and specifying the new service level desired.  The following provides the support service levels offered by Enthought:

<br />
<br /><br />
4. Term and Termination
<br />
<br /><br />
The Term of this Agreement shall extend from the Effective Date through the Initial Term and any Renewal Term.  Enthought may terminate this agreement upon written notice to Customer if Customer fails to pay the Annual Subscription Fees when and as due, or upon Customer's breach of any of the terms and conditions of this Agreement.  Customer may terminate this Agreement at any time upon written notice to Enthought.  Upon termination of this Agreement, Customer shall have perpetual use of the version or versions of EPD used by Customer at the time of termination, but Customer shall not have access to Subscription Services, Customer will not be entitled to any refund of any portion of the Annual Subscription Fees, and Enthought will have no further obligation or liability to Customer after such termination.
<br />

<br />
<br /><br />
8. Indemnity

A. HISTORY OF THE SOFTWARE
<br />
==========================
<br />
<br /><br />
Python was created in the early 1990s by Guido van Rossum at Stichting
<br />
Mathematisch Centrum (CWI, see http://www.cwi.nl) in the Netherlands
<br />
as a successor of a language called ABC.  Guido remains Python's
<br />
principal author, although it includes many contributions from others.
<br />
<br /><br />
In 1995, Guido continued his work on Python at the Corporation for
<br />
National Research Initiatives (CNRI, see http://www.cnri.reston.va.us)
<br />
in Reston, Virginia where he released several versions of the
<br />
software.
<br />
<br /><br />
In May 2000, Guido and the Python core development team moved to
<br />
BeOpen.com to form the BeOpen PythonLabs team.  In October of the same
<br />
year, the PythonLabs team moved to Digital Creations (now Zope
<br />
Corporation, see http://www.zope.com).  In 2001, the Python Software
<br />
Foundation (PSF, see http://www.python.org/psf/) was formed, a
<br />
non-profit organization created specifically to own Python-related
<br />
Intellectual Property.  Zope Corporation is a sponsoring member of
<br />
the PSF.
<br />
<br /><br />
All Python releases are Open Source (see http://www.opensource.org for
<br />
the Open Source Definition).  Historically, most, but not all, Python
<br />
releases have also been GPL-compatible; the table below summarizes
<br />
the various releases.

Footnotes:
<br />
<br /><br />
(1) GPL-compatible doesn't mean that we're distributing Python under
<br />
    the GPL.  All Python licenses, unlike the GPL, let you distribute
<br />
    a modified version without making your changes open source.  The
<br />
    GPL-compatible licenses make it possible to combine Python with
<br />
    other software that is released under the GPL; the others don't.
<br />
<br /><br />
(2) According to Richard Stallman, 1.6.1 is not GPL-compatible,
<br />
    because its license has a choice of law clause.  According to
<br />
    CNRI, however, Stallman's lawyer has told CNRI's lawyer that 1.6.1
<br />
    is "not incompatible" with the GPL.
<br />
<br /><br />
Thanks to the many outside volunteers who have worked under Guido's
<br />
direction to make these releases possible.

The licenses granted in this Section 2 are the only rights granted under this License. No additional rights or licenses will be implied from the distribution or licensing of Covered Software under this License. Notwithstanding Section 2.1(b) above, no patent license is granted by a Contributor:
<br />
<br /><br />
    for any code that a Contributor has removed from Covered Software; or
<br />
<br /><br />
    for infringements caused by: (i) Your and any other third party�s modifications of Covered Software, or (ii) the combination of its Contributions with other software (except as part of its Contributor Version); or
<br />
<br /><br />
    under Patent Claims infringed by Covered Software in the absence of its Contributions.
<br />
<br /><br />
This License does not grant any rights in the trademarks, service marks, or logos of any Contributor (except as may be necessary to comply with the notice requirements in Section 3.4).
<br />
<br /><br />
2.4. Subsequent Licenses
<br />
No Contributor makes additional grants as a result of Your choice to distribute the Covered Software under a subsequent version of this License (see Section 10.2) or under the terms of a Secondary License (if permitted under the terms of Section 3.3).
<br />
<br /><br />
2.5. Representation
<br />
<br /><br />
Each Contributor represents that the Contributor believes its Contributions are its original creation(s) or it has sufficient rights to grant the rights to its Contributions conveyed by this License.
<br />
<br /><br />
2.6. Fair Use
<br />
This License is not intended to limit any rights You have under applicable copyright doctrines of fair use, fair dealing, or other equivalents.
<br />
<br /><br />
2.7. Conditions
<br />
Sections 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, and 3.4 are conditions of the licenses granted in Section 2.1.
<br />
<br /><br />
3. Responsibilities
<br />
3.1. Distribution of Source Form
<br />
<br /><br />
All distribution of Covered Software in Source Code Form, including any Modifications that You create or to which You contribute, must be under the terms of this License. You must inform recipients that the Source Code Form of the Covered Software is governed by the terms of this License, and how they can obtain a copy of this License. You may not attempt to alter or restrict the recipients� rights in the Source Code Form.
<br />
<br /><br />
3.2. Distribution of Executable Form
<br />
If You distribute Covered Software in Executable Form then:
<br />
<br /><br />
    such Covered Software must also be made available in Source Code Form, as described in Section 3.1, and You must inform recipients of the Executable Form how they can obtain a copy of such Source Code Form by reasonable means in a timely manner, at a charge no more than the cost of distribution to the recipient; and
<br />
<br /><br />
    You may distribute such Executable Form under the terms of this License, or sublicense it under different terms, provided that the license for the Executable Form does not attempt to limit or alter the recipients� rights in the Source Code Form under this License.
<br />
<br /><br />
3.3. Distribution of a Larger Work
<br />
You may create and distribute a Larger Work under terms of Your choice, provided that You also comply with the requirements of this License for the Covered Software. If the Larger Work is a combination of Covered Software with a work governed by one or more Secondary Licenses, and the Covered Software is not Incompatible With Secondary Licenses, this License permits You to additionally distribute such Covered Software under the terms of such Secondary License(s), so that the recipient of the Larger Work may, at their option, further distribute the Covered Software under the terms of either this License or such Secondary License(s).
<br />
<br /><br />
3.4. Notices
<br />
You may not remove or alter the substance of any license notices (including copyright notices, patent notices, disclaimers of warranty, or limitations of liability) contained within the Source Code Form of the Covered Software, except that You may alter any license notices to the extent required to remedy known factual inaccuracies.
<br />
<br /><br />
3.5. Application of Additional Terms
<br />
You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered Software. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any such warranty, support, indemnity, or liability obligation is offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify every Contributor for any liability incurred by such Contributor as a result of warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms You offer. You may include additional disclaimers of warranty and limitations of liability specific to any jurisdiction.
<br />
<br /><br />
4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation
<br />
If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this License with respect to some or all of the Covered Software due to statute, judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b) describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description must be placed in a text file included with all distributions of the Covered Software under this License. Except to the extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such description must be sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it.
<br />
<br /><br />
5. Termination
<br />
5.1. The rights granted under this License will terminate automatically if You fail to comply with any of its terms. However, if You become compliant, then the rights granted under this License from a particular Contributor are reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until such Contributor explicitly and finally terminates Your grants, and (b) on an ongoing basis, if such Contributor fails to notify You of the non-compliance by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after You have come back into compliance. Moreover, Your grants from a particular Contributor are reinstated on an ongoing basis if such Contributor notifies You of the non-compliance by some reasonable means, this is the first time You have received notice of non-compliance with this License from such Contributor, and You become compliant prior to 30 days after Your receipt of the notice.
<br />
<br /><br />
5.2. If You initiate litigation against any entity by asserting a patent infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions, counter-claims, and cross-claims) alleging that a Contributor Version directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then the rights granted to You by any and all Contributors for the Covered Software under Section 2.1 of this License shall terminate.
<br />
<br /><br />
5.3. In the event of termination under Sections 5.1 or 5.2 above, all end user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which have been validly granted by You or Your distributors under this License prior to termination shall survive termination.
<br />
<br /><br />
6. Disclaimer of Warranty
<br />
Covered Software is provided under this License on an "as is" basis, without warranty of any kind, either expressed, implied, or statutory, including, without limitation, warranties that the Covered Software is free of defects, merchantable, fit for a particular purpose or non-infringing. The entire risk as to the quality and performance of the Covered Software is with You. Should any Covered Software prove defective in any respect, You (not any Contributor) assume the cost of any necessary servicing, repair, or correction. This disclaimer of warranty constitutes an essential part of this License. No use of any Covered Software is authorized under this License except under this disclaimer.
<br />
<br /><br />
7. Limitation of Liability
<br />
Under no circumstances and under no legal theory, whether tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, shall any Contributor, or anyone who distributes Covered Software as permitted above, be liable to You for any direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any character including, without limitation, damages for lost profits, loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other commercial damages or losses, even if such party shall have been informed of the possibility of such damages. This limitation of liability shall not apply to liability for death or personal injury resulting from such party�s negligence to the extent applicable law prohibits such limitation. Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or consequential damages, so this exclusion and limitation may not apply to You.
<br />
<br /><br />
8. Litigation
<br />
Any litigation relating to this License may be brought only in the courts of a jurisdiction where the defendant maintains its principal place of business and such litigation shall be governed by laws of that jurisdiction, without reference to its conflict-of-law provisions. Nothing in this Section shall prevent a party�s ability to bring cross-claims or counter-claims.
<br />
<br /><br />
9. Miscellaneous
<br />
This License represents the complete agreement concerning the subject matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it enforceable. Any law or regulation which provides that the language of a contract shall be construed against the drafter shall not be used to construe this License against a Contributor.
<br />
<br /><br />
10. Versions of the License
<br />
10.1. New Versions
<br />
Mozilla Foundation is the license steward. Except as provided in Section 10.3, no one other than the license steward has the right to modify or publish new versions of this License. Each version will be given a distinguishing version number.
<br />
<br /><br />
10.2. Effect of New Versions
<br />
You may distribute the Covered Software under the terms of the version of the License under which You originally received the Covered Software, or under the terms of any subsequent version published by the license steward.
<br />
<br /><br />
10.3. Modified Versions
<br />
If you create software not governed by this License, and you want to create a new license for such software, you may create and use a modified version of this License if you rename the license and remove any references to the name of the license steward (except to note that such modified license differs from this License).
<br />
<br /><br />
10.4. Distributing Source Code Form that is Incompatible With Secondary Licenses
<br />
If You choose to distribute Source Code Form that is Incompatible With Secondary Licenses under the terms of this version of the License, the notice described in Exhibit B of this License must be attached.

<br /><br />
Use of NVIDIA's SOFTWARE requires three elements: the SOFTWARE, an NVIDIA GPU or application processor ("NVIDIA Hardware"), and a computer system. The SOFTWARE is protected by copyright laws and international copyright treaties, as well as other intellectual property laws and treaties. The SOFTWARE is not sold, and instead is only licensed for Your use, strictly in accordance with this Agreement. The NVIDIA Hardware is protected by various patents, and is sold, but this Agreement does not cover the sale or use of such hardware, since it may not necessarily be sold as a package with the SOFTWARE. This Agreement sets forth the terms and conditions of the SOFTWARE only. 
<br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
1. DEFINITIONS 
<br />

<br /><br />
<br /><br />
2.1 Rights and Limitations of Grant. Provided that Licensee complies with the terms of this Agreement, NVIDIA hereby grants Licensee the following limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-sublicensable (except as expressly permitted otherwise for Redistributable Software in Sections 2.1.2 and 2.1.3 of this Agreement) right to use the SOFTWARE, with the following limitations: 
<br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />

"Enterprise" shall mean individual use by Licensee or any legal entity (such as a corporation or university) and the subsidiaries it owns by more than 50 percent.
<br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
2.1.2 Redistribution Rights.  Licensee may transfer, redistribute, and sublicense certain files of the Redistributable SOFTWARE, as defined in Attachment A of this Agreement, provided, however, that (a) the Redistributable SOFTWARE shall be distributed solely in binary form to Licensee's licensees ("Customers") only as a component of Licensee's own software products (each, a "Licensee Application"); (b) Licensee shall design the Licensee Application such that the Redistributable SOFTWARE files are installed only in a private (non-shared) directory location that is used only by the Licensee Application; (c) Licensee shall obtain each Customer's written or clickwrap agreement to the license terms under a written, legally enforceable agreement that has the effect of protecting the SOFTWARE and the rights of NVIDIA under terms no less restrictive than this Agreement.    
<br />

<br /><br />
<br /><br />
2.1.3 Further Redistribution Rights. Subject to the terms and conditions of the Agreement, Licensee may authorize Customers to further redistribute the Redistributable SOFTWARE that such Customers receive as part of the Licensee Application, solely in binary form, provided, however, that Licensee shall require in their standard software license agreements with Customers that all such redistributions must be made pursuant to a license agreement that has the effect of protecting the SOFTWARE and the rights of NVIDIA whose terms and conditions are at least as restrictive as those in the applicable Licensee software license agreement covering the Licensee Application. For avoidance of doubt, termination of this Agreement shall not affect rights previously granted by Licensee to its Customers under this Agreement to the extent validly granted to Customers under Section 2.1.2. 
<br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
2.1.4 Linux/FreeBSD Exception. Notwithstanding the foregoing terms of Sections 2.1.1, 2.1.2 and 2.1.3, SOFTWARE designed exclusively for use on the Linux or FreeBSD operating systems, or other operating systems derived from the source code to these operating systems, may be copied and redistributed, provided that the binary files thereof are not modified in any way (except for unzipping of compressed files).

<br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
7.1 Feedback. Notwithstanding any Non-Disclosure Agreement executed by and between the parties, the parties agree that in the event Licensee or NVIDIA provides Feedback (as defined below) to the other party   on how to design, implement, or improve the SOFTWARE or Licensee's product(s) for use with the SOFTWARE, the following terms and conditions apply the Feedback:
<br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
7.1.1	Exchange of Feedback. Both parties agree that neither party has an obligation to give the other party any suggestions, comments or other feedback, whether verbally or in written or source code form, relating to (i) the SOFTWARE; (ii) Licensee's products; (iii) Licensee's use of the SOFTWARE; or (iv) optimization/interoperability of  Licensee's product with the SOFTWARE (collectively defined as "Feedback").  In the event either party provides Feedback to the other party, the party receiving the Feedback may use any Feedback that the other party voluntarily provides to improve the (i) SOFTWARE or other related NVIDIA technologies, respectively for the benefit of NVIDIA; or (ii) Licensee's product or other related Licensee technologies, respectively for the benefit of Licensee.  Accordingly, if either party provides Feedback to the other party, both parties agree that the other party and its respective licensees may freely use, reproduce, license, distribute, and otherwise commercialize the Feedback in the (i) SOFTWARE or other related technologies; or (ii) Licensee's products or other related technologies, respectively, without the payment of any royalties or fees.
<br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
7.1.2	Residual Rights.

NVIDIA shall not have any obligation to limit or restrict the assignment of such employees, agents or contractors or to pay royalties for any work resulting from the use of Residuals.
<br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
7.1.3	Disclaimer of Warranty.

<br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />

<br /><br />
<br /><br />

<br /><br />
Why pthreads-win32 did not use the GNU General Public License
<br />
-------------------------------------------------------------
<br />
<br /><br />
    The goal of the pthreads-win32 project has been to
<br />
    provide a quality and complete implementation of the POSIX
<br />
    threads API for Microsoft Windows within the limits imposed
<br />
    by virtue of it being a stand-alone library and not
<br />
    linked directly to other POSIX compliant libraries. For
<br />
    example, some functions and features, such as those based
<br />
    on POSIX signals, are missing.
<br />
<br /><br />
    Pthreads-win32 is a library, available in several different
<br />
    versions depending on supported compilers, and may be used
<br />
    as a dynamically linked module or a statically linked set of
<br />
    binary modules. It is not an application on it's own.
<br />
<br /><br />
    It was fully intended that pthreads-win32 be usable with
<br />
    commercial software not covered by either the GPL or the LGPL
<br />
    licenses. Pthreads-win32 has many contributors to it's
<br />
    code base, many of whom have done so because they have
<br />
    used the library in commercial or proprietry software
<br />
    projects.
<br />
<br /><br />
    Releasing pthreads-win32 under the LGPL ensures that the
<br />
    library can be used widely, while at the same time ensures
<br />
    that bug fixes and improvements to the pthreads-win32 code
<br />
    itself is returned to benefit all current and future users
<br />
    of the library.
<br />
<br /><br />
    Although pthreads-win32 makes it possible for applications
<br />
    that use POSIX threads to be ported to Win32 platforms, the
<br />
    broader goal of the project is to encourage the use of open
<br />
    standards, and in particular, to make it just a little easier
<br />
    for developers writing Win32 applications to consider
<br />
    widening the potential market for their products.

			    Preamble
<br />
<br /><br />
  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
<br />
freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
<br />
Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change
<br />
free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.
<br />
<br /><br />
  This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some
<br />
specially designated software packages--typically libraries--of the
<br />
Free Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it.  You
<br />
can use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether
<br />
this license or the ordinary General Public License is the better
<br />
strategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations below.
<br />
<br /><br />
  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use,
<br />
not price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that
<br />
you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge
<br />
for this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get
<br />
it if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of
<br />
it in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do
<br />
these things.
<br />
<br /><br />
  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
<br />
distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these
<br />
rights.  These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for
<br />
you if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.
<br />
<br /><br />
  For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis
<br />
or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave
<br />
you.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source
<br />
code.  If you link other code with the library, you must provide
<br />
complete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them
<br />
with the library after making changes to the library and recompiling
<br />
it.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.
<br />
<br /><br />
  We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the
<br />
library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal
<br />
permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.
<br />
<br /><br />
  To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that
<br />
there is no warranty for the free library.  Also, if the library is
<br />
modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know
<br />
that what they have is not the original version, so that the original
<br />
author's reputation will not be affected by problems that might be
<br />
introduced by others.
<br />
<br /><br />
  Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of
<br />
any free program.  We wish to make sure that a company cannot
<br />
effectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a
<br />
restrictive license from a patent holder.  Therefore, we insist that
<br />
any patent license obtained for a version of the library must be
<br />
consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.
<br />
<br /><br />
  Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the
<br />
ordinary GNU General Public License.  This license, the GNU Lesser
<br />
General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and
<br />
is quite different from the ordinary General Public License.  We use
<br />
this license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those
<br />
libraries into non-free programs.
<br />
<br /><br />
  When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using
<br />
a shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a
<br />
combined work, a derivative of the original library.  The ordinary
<br />
General Public License therefore permits such linking only if the
<br />
entire combination fits its criteria of freedom.  The Lesser General
<br />
Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with
<br />
the library.
<br />
<br /><br />
  We call this license the "Lesser" General Public License because it
<br />
does Less to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General
<br />
Public License.  It also provides other free software developers Less
<br />
of an advantage over competing non-free programs.  These disadvantages
<br />
are the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many
<br />
libraries.  However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain
<br />
special circumstances.
<br />
<br /><br />
  For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to
<br />
encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it becomes
<br />
a de-facto standard.  To achieve this, non-free programs must be
<br />
allowed to use the library.  A more frequent case is that a free
<br />
library does the same job as widely used non-free libraries.  In this
<br />
case, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free
<br />
software only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.
<br />
<br /><br />
  In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free
<br />
programs enables a greater number of people to use a large body of
<br />
free software.  For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in
<br />
non-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU
<br />
operating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating
<br />
system.
<br />
<br /><br />
  Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the
<br />
users' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is
<br />
linked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run
<br />
that program using a modified version of the Library.
<br />
<br /><br />
  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
<br />
modification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between a
<br />
"work based on the library" and a "work that uses the library".  The
<br />
former contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must
<br />
be combined with the library in order to run.
<br />
<br /><br />
		  GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
<br />
   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION
<br />
<br /><br />
  0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other
<br />
program which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or
<br />
other authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of
<br />
this Lesser General Public License (also called "this License").
<br />
Each licensee is addressed as "you".
<br />
<br /><br />
  A "library" means a collection of software functions and/or data
<br />
prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs
<br />
(which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.
<br />
<br /><br />
  The "Library", below, refers to any such software library or work
<br />
which has been distributed under these terms.  A "work based on the
<br />
Library" means either the Library or any derivative work under
<br />
copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a
<br />
portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated
<br />
straightforwardly into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is
<br />
included without limitation in the term "modification".)
<br />
<br /><br />
  "Source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for
<br />
making modifications to it.  For a library, complete source code means
<br />
all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated
<br />
interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation
<br />
and installation of the library.
<br />
<br /><br />
  Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
<br />
covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
<br />
running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from
<br />
such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based
<br />
on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for
<br />
writing it).  Whether that is true depends on what the Library does
<br />
and what the program that uses the Library does.
<br />
<br /><br />
  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's
<br />
complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that
<br />
you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an
<br />
appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact
<br />
all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any
<br />
warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the
<br />
Library.
<br />
<br /><br />
  You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,
<br />
and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a
<br />
fee
<br />
<br /><br />
  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion
<br />
of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and
<br />
distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
<br />
above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:
<br />
<br /><br />
    a) The modified work must itself be a software library.
<br />
<br /><br />
    b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices
<br />
    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.
<br />
<br /><br />
    c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no
<br />
    charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.
<br />
<br /><br />
    d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a
<br />
    table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses
<br />
    the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility
<br />
    is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,
<br />
    in the event an application does not supply such function or
<br />
    table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of
<br />
    its purpose remains meaningful.
<br />
<br /><br />
    (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has
<br />
    a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the
<br />
    application.  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any
<br />
    application-supplied function or table used by this function must
<br />
    be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square
<br />
    root function must still compute square roots.)
<br />
<br /><br />
These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
<br />
identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,
<br />
and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
<br />
themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
<br />
sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
<br />
distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
<br />
on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
<br />
this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
<br />
entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote
<br />
it.
<br />
<br /><br />
Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
<br />
your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
<br />
exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
<br />
collective works based on the Library.
<br />
<br /><br />
In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library
<br />
with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of
<br />
a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
<br />
the scope of this License.
<br />
<br /><br />
  3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public
<br />
License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.  To do
<br />
this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so
<br />
that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,
<br />
instead of to this License.  (If a newer version than version 2 of the
<br />
ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify
<br />
that version instead if you wish.)  Do not make any other change in
<br />
these notices.
<br />
<br /><br />
  Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for
<br />
that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all
<br />
subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.
<br />
<br /><br />
  This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of
<br />
the Library into a program that is not a library.
<br />
<br /><br />
  4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or
<br />
derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form
<br />
under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany
<br />
it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which
<br />
must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a
<br />
medium customarily used for software interchange.
<br />
<br /><br />
  If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy
<br />
from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the
<br />
source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to
<br />
distribute the source code, even though third parties are not
<br />
compelled to copy the source along with the object code.
<br />
<br /><br />
  5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the
<br />
Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or
<br />
linked with it, is called a "work that uses the Library".  Such a
<br />
work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and
<br />
therefore falls outside the scope of this License.
<br />
<br /><br />
  However, linking a "work that uses the Library" with the Library
<br />
creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it
<br />
contains portions of the Library), rather than a "work that uses the
<br />
library".  The executable is therefore covered by this License.
<br />
Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.
<br />
<br /><br />
  When a "work that uses the Library" uses material from a header file
<br />
that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a
<br />
derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.
<br />
Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be
<br />
linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.  The
<br />
threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.
<br />
<br /><br />
  If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data
<br />
structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline
<br />
functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object
<br />
file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative
<br />
work.  (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the
<br />
Library will still fall under Section 6.)
<br />
<br /><br />
  Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may
<br />
distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.
<br />
Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,
<br />
whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.
<br />
<br /><br />
  6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or
<br />
link a "work that uses the Library" with the Library to produce a
<br />
work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work
<br />
under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit
<br />
modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse
<br />
engineering for debugging such modifications.
<br />
<br /><br />
  You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the
<br />
Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by
<br />
this License.  You must supply a copy of this License.  If the work
<br />
during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the
<br />
copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference
<br />
directing the user to the copy of this License.  Also, you must do one
<br />
of these things:
<br />
<br /><br />
    a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding
<br />
    machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever
<br />
    changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under
<br />
    Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked
<br />
    with the Library, with the complete machine-readable "work that
<br />
    uses the Library", as object code and/or source code, so that the
<br />
    user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified
<br />
    executable containing the modified Library.  (It is understood
<br />
    that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the
<br />
    Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application
<br />
    to use the modified definitions.)
<br />
<br /><br />
    b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the
<br />
    Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a
<br />
    copy of the library already present on the user's computer system,
<br />
    rather than copying library functions into the executable, and (2)
<br />
    will operate properly with a modified version of the library, if
<br />
    the user installs one, as long as the modified version is
<br />
    interface-compatible with the version that the work was made with.
<br />
<br /><br />
    c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at
<br />
    least three years, to give the same user the materials
<br />
    specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more
<br />
    than the cost of performing this distribution.
<br />
<br /><br />
    d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy
<br />
    from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above
<br />
    specified materials from the same place.
<br />
<br /><br />
    e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these
<br />
    materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.
<br />
<br /><br />
  For an executable, the required form of the "work that uses the
<br />
Library" must include any data and utility programs needed for
<br />
reproducing the executable from it.  However, as a special exception,
<br />
the materials to be distributed need not include anything that is
<br />
normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major
<br />
components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on
<br />
which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies
<br />
the executable.
<br />
<br /><br />
  It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license
<br />
restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally
<br />
accompany the operating system.  Such a contradiction means you cannot
<br />
use both them and the Library together in an executable that you
<br />
distribute.
<br />
<br /><br />
  7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the
<br />
Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library
<br />
facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined
<br />
library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on
<br />
the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise
<br />
permitted, and provided that you do these two things:
<br />
<br /><br />
    a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work
<br />
    based on the Library, uncombined with any other library
<br />
    facilities.  This must be distributed under the terms of the
<br />
    Sections above.
<br />
<br /><br />
    b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact
<br />
    that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining
<br />
    where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.
<br />
<br /><br />
  8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute
<br />
the Library except as expressly provided under this License.  Any
<br />
attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or
<br />
distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your
<br />
rights under this License.  However, parties who have received copies,
<br />
or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses
<br />
terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.
<br />
<br /><br />
  9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
<br />
signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
<br />
distribute the Library or its derivative works.  These actions are
<br />
prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
<br />
modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the
<br />
Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
<br />
all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
<br />
the Library or works based on it.
<br />
<br /><br />
  10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the
<br />
Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
<br />
original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library
<br />
subject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
<br />
restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
<br />
You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with
<br />
this License.
<br />
<br /><br />
  11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
<br />
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
<br />
conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
<br />
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
<br />
excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
<br />
distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
<br />
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
<br />
may not distribute the Library at all.  For example, if a patent
<br />
license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by
<br />
all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
<br />
the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
<br />
refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.
<br />
<br /><br />
If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any
<br />
particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply,
<br />
and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.
<br />
<br /><br />
It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
<br />
patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
<br />
such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
<br />
integrity of the free software distribution system which is
<br />
implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
<br />
generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
<br />
through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
<br />
system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
<br />
to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
<br />
impose that choice.
<br />
<br /><br />
This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
<br />
be a consequence of the rest of this License.
<br />
<br /><br />
  12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in
<br />
certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
<br />
original copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add
<br />
an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries,
<br />
so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus
<br />
excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if
<br />
written in the body of this License.
<br />
<br /><br />
  13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new
<br />
versions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time.
<br />
Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,
<br />
but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.
<br />
<br /><br />
Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Library
<br />
specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and
<br />
"any later version", you have the option of following the terms and
<br />
conditions either of that version or of any later version published by
<br />
the Free Software Foundation.  If the Library does not specify a
<br />
license version number, you may choose any version ever published by
<br />
the Free Software Foundation.
<br />
<br /><br />
  14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free
<br />
programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,
<br />
write to the author to ask for permission.  For software which is
<br />
copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free
<br />
Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our
<br />
decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status
<br />
of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing
<br />
and reuse of software generally.
<br />
<br /><br />
			    NO WARRANTY
<br />
<br /><br />
  15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO
<br />
WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.
<br />
EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR
<br />
OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY
<br />
KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE
<br />
IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
<br />
PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE
<br />
LIBRARY IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME
<br />
THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
<br />
<br /><br />
  16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN
<br />
WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY
<br />
AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU
<br />
FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR
<br />
CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE
<br />
LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING
<br />
RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A
<br />
FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF
<br />
SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
<br />
DAMAGES.
<br />
<br /><br />
		     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
<br />
<br /><br />
           How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries
<br />
<br /><br />
  If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest
<br />
possible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that
<br />
everyone can redistribute and change.  You can do so by permitting
<br />
redistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms of the
<br />
ordinary General Public License).
<br />
<br /><br />
  To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library.  It is
<br />
safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
<br />
convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the
<br />
"copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.

<br />
      the copyright owner that is granting the License.
<br />
<br /><br />
      "Legal Entity" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all
<br />
      other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
<br />
      control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,
<br />
      "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the

<br />
<br /><br />

      "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
<br />
      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
<br />
      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
<br />
      and conversions to other media types.
<br />
<br /><br />
      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
<br />
      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
<br />
      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work

      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).
<br />
<br /><br />
      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
<br />
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
<br />
      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
<br />
      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
<br />
      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
<br />
      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
<br />
      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
<br />
<br /><br />
      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
<br />
      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
<br />
      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
<br />
      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
<br />
      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
<br />
      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
<br />
      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
<br />
      to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
<br />
      communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
<br />
      and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
<br />
      Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
<br />
      excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
<br />
      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."
<br />
<br /><br />
      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity

   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
<br />
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
<br />
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
<br />
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
<br />
      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
<br />
      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
<br />
<br /><br />
   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of

<br />
      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
<br />
      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
<br />
      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
<br />
      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
<br />
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
<br />
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
<br />
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
<br />
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
<br />
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
<br />
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
<br />
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
<br />
      as of the date such litigation is filed.
<br />
<br /><br />
   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
<br />
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
<br />
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
<br />
      meet the following conditions:
<br />
<br /><br />
      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
<br />
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
<br />
<br /><br />
      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
<br />
          stating that You changed the files; and
<br />
<br /><br />
      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
<br />
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
<br />
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
<br />
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
<br />
          the Derivative Works; and
<br />
<br /><br />
      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
<br />
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
<br />
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
<br />
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
<br />
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
<br />
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
<br />
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
<br />
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
<br />
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
<br />
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
<br />
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
<br />
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
<br />
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
<br />
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
<br />
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
<br />
          as modifying the License.
<br />
<br /><br />
      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
<br />
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
<br />
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
<br />
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
<br />
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
<br />
      the conditions stated in this License.
<br />
<br /><br />
   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
<br />
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
<br />
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
<br />
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
<br />
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
<br />
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
<br />
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
<br />
<br /><br />
   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
<br />
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
<br />
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
<br />
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
<br />
<br /><br />
   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
<br />
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
<br />
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
<br />
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
<br />
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
<br />
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
<br />
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
<br />
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
<br />
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
<br />
<br /><br />
   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
<br />
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
<br />
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
<br />
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
<br />
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
<br />
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
<br />
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
<br />
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
<br />
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
<br />
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
<br />
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
<br />
<br /><br />
   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
<br />
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
<br />
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
<br />
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
<br />
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
<br />
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
<br />
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
<br />
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
<br />
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
<br />
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
<br />
<br /><br />
   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

Grant of Patent License: Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work, where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s) with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You institute patent litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.
<br />
<br /><br />
4. Redistribution: You may reproduce and distribute copies of the Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You meet the following conditions:
<br />
You must give any other recipients of the Work or Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
<br />
You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices stating that You changed the files; and
<br />
You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and attribution notices from the Source form of the Work, excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of the Derivative Works; and
<br />
If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or, within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed as modifying the License.
<br />
You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and may provide additional or different license terms and conditions for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use, reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with the conditions stated in this License.
<br />
<br /><br />
5. Submission of Contributions: Unless You explicitly state otherwise, any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of this License, without any additional terms or conditions. Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
<br />
<br /><br />
6. Trademarks: This License does not grant permission to use the trade names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor, except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

Disclaimer of Warranty: Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
<br />
<br /><br />
8. Limitation of Liability: In no event and under no legal theory, whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
<br />
<br /><br />
9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability: While redistributing the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer, and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity, or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this License.

<br /><br />
 Copyright (C) 1991, 1999 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
<br />
     59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA  02111-1307  USA
<br />
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
<br />
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
<br />
<br /><br />
[This is the first released version of the Lesser GPL.  It also counts
<br />
 as the successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2, hence
<br />
 the version number 2.1.]
<br />
<br /><br />
			    Preamble
<br />
<br /><br />
  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
<br />
freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
<br />
Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change
<br />
free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.
<br />
<br /><br />
  This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some
<br />
specially designated software packages--typically libraries--of the
<br />
Free Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it.  You
<br />
can use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether
<br />
this license or the ordinary General Public License is the better
<br />
strategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations below.
<br />
<br /><br />
  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use,
<br />
not price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that
<br />
you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge
<br />
for this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get
<br />
it if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of
<br />
it in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do
<br />
these things.
<br />
<br /><br />
  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
<br />
distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these
<br />
rights.  These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for
<br />
you if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.
<br />
<br /><br />
  For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis
<br />
or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave
<br />
you.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source
<br />
code.  If you link other code with the library, you must provide
<br />
complete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them
<br />
with the library after making changes to the library and recompiling
<br />
it.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.
<br />
<br /><br />
  We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the
<br />
library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal
<br />
permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.
<br />
<br /><br />
  To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that
<br />
there is no warranty for the free library.  Also, if the library is
<br />
modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know
<br />
that what they have is not the original version, so that the original
<br />
author's reputation will not be affected by problems that might be
<br />
introduced by others.
<br />
<br /><br />
  Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of
<br />
any free program.  We wish to make sure that a company cannot
<br />
effectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a
<br />
restrictive license from a patent holder.  Therefore, we insist that
<br />
any patent license obtained for a version of the library must be
<br />
consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.
<br />
<br /><br />
  Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the
<br />
ordinary GNU General Public License.  This license, the GNU Lesser
<br />
General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and
<br />
is quite different from the ordinary General Public License.  We use
<br />
this license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those
<br />
libraries into non-free programs.
<br />
<br /><br />
  When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using
<br />
a shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a
<br />
combined work, a derivative of the original library.  The ordinary
<br />
General Public License therefore permits such linking only if the
<br />
entire combination fits its criteria of freedom.  The Lesser General
<br />
Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with
<br />
the library.
<br />
<br /><br />
  We call this license the "Lesser" General Public License because it
<br />
does Less to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General
<br />
Public License.  It also provides other free software developers Less
<br />
of an advantage over competing non-free programs.  These disadvantages
<br />
are the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many
<br />
libraries.  However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain
<br />
special circumstances.
<br />
<br /><br />
  For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to
<br />
encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it becomes
<br />
a de-facto standard.  To achieve this, non-free programs must be
<br />
allowed to use the library.  A more frequent case is that a free
<br />
library does the same job as widely used non-free libraries.  In this
<br />
case, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free
<br />
software only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.
<br />
<br /><br />
  In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free
<br />
programs enables a greater number of people to use a large body of
<br />
free software.  For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in
<br />
non-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU
<br />
operating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating
<br />
system.
<br />
<br /><br />
  Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the
<br />
users' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is
<br />
linked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run
<br />
that program using a modified version of the Library.
<br />
<br /><br />
  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
<br />
modification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between a
<br />
"work based on the library" and a "work that uses the library".  The
<br />
former contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must
<br />
be combined with the library in order to run.
<br />
<br /><br />
		  GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
<br />
   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION
<br />
<br /><br />
  0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other
<br />
program which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or
<br />
other authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of
<br />
this Lesser General Public License (also called "this License").
<br />
Each licensee is addressed as "you".
<br />
<br /><br />
  A "library" means a collection of software functions and/or data
<br />
prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs
<br />
(which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.
<br />
<br /><br />
  The "Library", below, refers to any such software library or work
<br />
which has been distributed under these terms.  A "work based on the
<br />
Library" means either the Library or any derivative work under
<br />
copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a
<br />
portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated
<br />
straightforwardly into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is
<br />
included without limitation in the term "modification".)
<br />
<br /><br />
  "Source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for
<br />
making modifications to it.  For a library, complete source code means
<br />
all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated
<br />
interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation
<br />
and installation of the library.
<br />
<br /><br />
  Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
<br />
covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
<br />
running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from
<br />
such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based
<br />
on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for
<br />
writing it).  Whether that is true depends on what the Library does
<br />
and what the program that uses the Library does.
<br />
<br /><br />
  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's
<br />
complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that
<br />
you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an
<br />
appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact
<br />
all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any
<br />
warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the
<br />
Library.
<br />
<br /><br />
  You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,
<br />
and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a
<br />
fee
<br />
<br /><br />
  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion
<br />
of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and
<br />
distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
<br />
above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:
<br />
<br /><br />
    a) The modified work must itself be a software library.
<br />
<br /><br />
    b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices
<br />
    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.
<br />
<br /><br />
    c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no
<br />
    charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.
<br />
<br /><br />
    d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a
<br />
    table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses
<br />
    the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility
<br />
    is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,
<br />
    in the event an application does not supply such function or
<br />
    table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of
<br />
    its purpose remains meaningful.
<br />
<br /><br />
    (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has
<br />
    a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the
<br />
    application.  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any
<br />
    application-supplied function or table used by this function must
<br />
    be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square
<br />
    root function must still compute square roots.)
<br />
<br /><br />
These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
<br />
identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,
<br />
and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
<br />
themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
<br />
sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
<br />
distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
<br />
on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
<br />
this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
<br />
entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote
<br />
it.
<br />
<br /><br />
Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
<br />
your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
<br />
exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
<br />
collective works based on the Library.
<br />
<br /><br />
In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library
<br />
with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of
<br />
a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
<br />
the scope of this License.
<br />
<br /><br />
  3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public
<br />
License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.  To do
<br />
this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so
<br />
that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,
<br />
instead of to this License.  (If a newer version than version 2 of the
<br />
ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify
<br />
that version instead if you wish.)  Do not make any other change in
<br />
these notices.
<br />
<br /><br />
  Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for
<br />
that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all
<br />
subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.
<br />
<br /><br />
  This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of
<br />
the Library into a program that is not a library.
<br />
<br /><br />
  4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or
<br />
derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form
<br />
under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany
<br />
it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which
<br />
must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a
<br />
medium customarily used for software interchange.
<br />
<br /><br />
  If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy
<br />
from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the
<br />
source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to
<br />
distribute the source code, even though third parties are not
<br />
compelled to copy the source along with the object code.
<br />
<br /><br />
  5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the
<br />
Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or
<br />
linked with it, is called a "work that uses the Library".  Such a
<br />
work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and
<br />
therefore falls outside the scope of this License.
<br />
<br /><br />
  However, linking a "work that uses the Library" with the Library
<br />
creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it
<br />
contains portions of the Library), rather than a "work that uses the
<br />
library".  The executable is therefore covered by this License.
<br />
Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.
<br />
<br /><br />
  When a "work that uses the Library" uses material from a header file
<br />
that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a
<br />
derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.
<br />
Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be
<br />
linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.  The
<br />
threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.
<br />
<br /><br />
  If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data
<br />
structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline
<br />
functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object
<br />
file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative
<br />
work.  (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the
<br />
Library will still fall under Section 6.)
<br />
<br /><br />
  Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may
<br />
distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.
<br />
Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,
<br />
whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.
<br />
<br /><br />
  6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or
<br />
link a "work that uses the Library" with the Library to produce a
<br />
work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work
<br />
under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit
<br />
modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse
<br />
engineering for debugging such modifications.
<br />
<br /><br />
  You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the
<br />
Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by
<br />
this License.  You must supply a copy of this License.  If the work
<br />
during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the
<br />
copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference
<br />
directing the user to the copy of this License.  Also, you must do one
<br />
of these things:
<br />
<br /><br />
    a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding
<br />
    machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever
<br />
    changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under
<br />
    Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked
<br />
    with the Library, with the complete machine-readable "work that
<br />
    uses the Library", as object code and/or source code, so that the
<br />
    user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified
<br />
    executable containing the modified Library.  (It is understood
<br />
    that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the
<br />
    Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application
<br />
    to use the modified definitions.)
<br />
<br /><br />
    b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the
<br />
    Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a
<br />
    copy of the library already present on the user's computer system,
<br />
    rather than copying library functions into the executable, and (2)
<br />
    will operate properly with a modified version of the library, if
<br />
    the user installs one, as long as the modified version is
<br />
    interface-compatible with the version that the work was made with.
<br />
<br /><br />
    c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at
<br />
    least three years, to give the same user the materials
<br />
    specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more
<br />
    than the cost of performing this distribution.
<br />
<br /><br />
    d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy
<br />
    from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above
<br />
    specified materials from the same place.
<br />
<br /><br />
    e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these
<br />
    materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.
<br />
<br /><br />
  For an executable, the required form of the "work that uses the
<br />
Library" must include any data and utility programs needed for
<br />
reproducing the executable from it.  However, as a special exception,
<br />
the materials to be distributed need not include anything that is
<br />
normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major
<br />
components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on
<br />
which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies
<br />
the executable.
<br />
<br /><br />
  It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license
<br />
restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally
<br />
accompany the operating system.  Such a contradiction means you cannot
<br />
use both them and the Library together in an executable that you
<br />
distribute.
<br />
<br /><br />
  7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the
<br />
Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library
<br />
facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined
<br />
library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on
<br />
the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise
<br />
permitted, and provided that you do these two things:
<br />
<br /><br />
    a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work
<br />
    based on the Library, uncombined with any other library
<br />
    facilities.  This must be distributed under the terms of the
<br />
    Sections above.
<br />
<br /><br />
    b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact
<br />
    that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining
<br />
    where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.
<br />
<br /><br />
  8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute
<br />
the Library except as expressly provided under this License.  Any
<br />
attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or
<br />
distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your
<br />
rights under this License.  However, parties who have received copies,
<br />
or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses
<br />
terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.
<br />
<br /><br />
  9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
<br />
signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
<br />
distribute the Library or its derivative works.  These actions are
<br />
prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
<br />
modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the
<br />
Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
<br />
all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
<br />
the Library or works based on it.
<br />
<br /><br />
  10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the
<br />
Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
<br />
original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library
<br />
subject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
<br />
restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
<br />
You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with
<br />
this License.
<br />
<br /><br />
  11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
<br />
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
<br />
conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
<br />
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
<br />
excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
<br />
distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
<br />
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
<br />
may not distribute the Library at all.  For example, if a patent
<br />
license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by
<br />
all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
<br />
the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
<br />
refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.
<br />
<br /><br />
If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any
<br />
particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply,
<br />
and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.
<br />
<br /><br />
It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
<br />
patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
<br />
such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
<br />
integrity of the free software distribution system which is
<br />
implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
<br />
generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
<br />
through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
<br />
system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
<br />
to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
<br />
impose that choice.
<br />
<br /><br />
This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
<br />
be a consequence of the rest of this License.
<br />
<br /><br />
  12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in
<br />
certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
<br />
original copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add
<br />
an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries,
<br />
so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus
<br />
excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if
<br />
written in the body of this License.
<br />
<br /><br />
  13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new
<br />
versions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time.
<br />
Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,
<br />
but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.
<br />
<br /><br />
Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Library
<br />
specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and
<br />
"any later version", you have the option of following the terms and
<br />
conditions either of that version or of any later version published by
<br />
the Free Software Foundation.  If the Library does not specify a
<br />
license version number, you may choose any version ever published by
<br />
the Free Software Foundation.
<br />
<br /><br />
  14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free
<br />
programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,
<br />
write to the author to ask for permission.  For software which is
<br />
copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free
<br />
Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our
<br />
decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status
<br />
of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing
<br />
and reuse of software generally.
<br />
<br /><br />
			    NO WARRANTY
<br />
<br /><br />
  15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO
<br />
WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.
<br />
EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR
<br />
OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY
<br />
KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE
<br />
IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
<br />
PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE
<br />
LIBRARY IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME
<br />
THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
<br />
<br /><br />
  16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN
<br />
WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY
<br />
AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU
<br />
FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR
<br />
CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE
<br />
LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING
<br />
RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A
<br />
FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF
<br />
SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
<br />
DAMAGES.
<br />
<br /><br />
		     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
<br />
<br /><br />
           How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries
<br />
<br /><br />
  If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest
<br />
possible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that
<br />
everyone can redistribute and change.  You can do so by permitting
<br />
redistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms of the
<br />
ordinary General Public License).
<br />
<br /><br />
  To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library.  It is
<br />
safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
<br />
convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the
<br />
"copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.
<br />
<br /><br />
    <one line to give the library's name and a brief idea of what it does.>
<br />
    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>
<br />
<br /><br />
    This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or
<br />
    modify it under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public
<br />
    License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either
<br />
    version 2.1 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.
<br />
<br /><br />
    This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
<br />
    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
<br />
    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the GNU
<br />
    Lesser General Public License for more details.
<br />
<br /><br />
    You should have received a copy of the GNU Lesser General Public
<br />
    License along with this library; if not, write to the Free Software
<br />
    Foundation, Inc., 59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA  02111-1307  USA
<br />
<br /><br />
Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.
<br />
<br /><br />
You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
<br />
school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the library, if
<br />
necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:
<br />
<br /><br />
  Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the
<br />
  library `Frob' (a library for tweaking knobs) written by James Random Hacker.
<br />
<br /><br />

NLopt License and Copyright
<br />
The NLopt library is under the GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPL), and the copyrights are owned by a variety of authors.
<br />
<br /><br />
In general, the different code in NLopt comes from different sources, and have a variety of licenses. For example, all of the new code we wrote for NLopt is under the MIT License (which imposes essentially no practical restrictions, and is hence compatible with the LGPL). The combination of all of this software is under the conjunction of the license terms, and in particular they are limited by the most restrictive of the licenses for the portions, which in this case is the LGPL. (The other portions of NLopt are under LGPL-compatible, less-restrictive licenses like the MIT license. So, if you remove the LGPL portions, which are currently code by Ladislav Luksan, the remainder reverts to a looser license.)
<br />
<br /><br />
New code written for NLopt, including tutorial code at NLopt Tutorial, is Copyright © 2007-2020 Massachusetts Institute of Technology and other authors, and comes with no warranty:

GENERAL
<br />
<br /><br />
-------
<br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Qt is available under a commercial license with various pricing models and packages that meet a variety of needs. Commercial Qt license keeps your code proprietary where only you can control and monetize on your end product�s development, user experience and distribution. You also get great perks like additional functionality, productivity enhancing tools, world-class support and a close strategic relationship with The Qt Company to make sure your product and development goals are met.
<br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Qt has been created under the belief of open development and providing freedom and choice to developers. To support that, The Qt Company also licenses Qt under open source licenses, where most of the functionality is available under LGPLv3. It should be noted that the tools as well as some add-on components are available only under GPLv3. In order to preserve the true meaning of open development and uphold the spirit of free software, it is imperative that the rules and regulations of open source licenses are followed. If you use Qt under open-source licenses, you need to make sure that you comply with all the licenses of the components you use.
<br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Qt also contains some 3rd party components that are available under different open-source licenses. Please refer to the documentation for more details on 3rd party licenses used in Qt.

<br />
<br /><br />
                       Version 3, 29 June 2007
<br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
 Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <http://fsf.org/>
<br />
<br /><br />
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
<br />
<br /><br />
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
<br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
                            Preamble
<br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
  The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for
<br />
<br /><br />
software and other kinds of works.
<br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
  The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed
<br />
<br /><br />
to take away your freedom to share and change the works.  By contrast,
<br />
<br /><br />
the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to
<br />
<br /><br />
share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free
<br />
<br /><br />
software for all its users.  We, the Free Software Foundation, use the
<br />
<br /><br />
GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to
<br />
<br /><br />
any other work released this way by its authors.  You can apply it to
<br />
<br /><br />
your programs, too.
<br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
<br />
<br /><br />
price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
<br />
<br /><br />
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
<br />
<br /><br />
them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you
<br />
<br /><br />
want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new
<br />
<br /><br />
free programs, and that you know you can do these things.
<br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
  To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you
<br />
<br /><br />
these rights or asking you to surrender the rights.  Therefore, you have
<br />
<br /><br />
certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if
<br />
<br /><br />
you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.
<br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
<br />
<br /><br />
gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same
<br />
<br /><br />
freedoms that you received.  You must make sure that they, too, receive
<br />
<br /><br />
or can get the source code.  And you must show them these terms so they
<br />
<br /><br />
know their rights.
<br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
  Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:
<br />
<br /><br />
(1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License
<br />
<br /><br />
giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.
<br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
  For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains
<br />
<br /><br />
that there is no warranty for this free software.  For both users' and
<br />
<br /><br />
authors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as
<br />
<br /><br />
changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to
<br />
<br /><br />
authors of previous versions.
<br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
  Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run
<br />
<br /><br />
modified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer
<br />
<br /><br />
can do so.  This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of
<br />
<br /><br />
protecting users' freedom to change the software.  The systematic
<br />
<br /><br />
pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to
<br />
<br /><br />
use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable.  Therefore, we
<br />
<br /><br />
have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those
<br />
<br /><br />
products.  If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we
<br />
<br /><br />
stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions
<br />
<br /><br />
of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.
<br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
  Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.
<br />
<br /><br />
States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of
<br />
<br /><br />
software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to
<br />
<br /><br />
avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could
<br />
<br /><br />
make it effectively proprietary.  To prevent this, the GPL assures that
<br />
<br /><br />
patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.
<br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
<br />
<br /><br />
modification follow.
<br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
                       TERMS AND CONDITIONS
<br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
  0. Definitions.
<br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
  "This License" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.
<br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
  "Copyright" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of
<br />
<br /><br />
works, such as semiconductor masks.
<br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
  "The Program" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this
<br />
<br /><br />
License.  Each licensee is addressed as "you".  "Licensees" and
<br />
<br /><br />
"recipients" may be individuals or organizations.
<br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
  To "modify" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work
<br />
<br /><br />
in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an
<br />
<br /><br />
exact copy.  The resulting work is called a "modified version" of the
<br />
<br /><br />
earlier work or a work "based on" the earlier work.
<br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
  A "covered work" means either the unmodified Program or a work based
<br />
<br /><br />
on the Program.
<br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
  To "propagate" a work means to do anything with it that, without
<br />
<br /><br />
permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for
<br />
<br /><br />
infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a
<br />
<br /><br />
computer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes copying,
<br />
<br /><br />
distribution (with or without modification), making available to the
<br />
<br /><br />
public, and in some countries other activities as well.
<br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
  To "convey" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other
<br />
<br /><br />
parties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user through
<br />
<br /><br />
a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.
<br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
  An interactive user interface displays "Appropriate Legal Notices"
<br />
<br /><br />
to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible
<br />
<br /><br />
feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)
<br />
<br /><br />
tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the
<br />
<br /><br />
extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the
<br />
<br /><br />
work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.  If
<br />
<br /><br />
the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a
<br />
<br /><br />
menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.
<br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
  1. Source Code.
<br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
  The "source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work
<br />
<br /><br />
for making modifications to it.  "Object code" means any non-source
<br />
<br /><br />
form of a work.
<br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
  A "Standard Interface" means an interface that either is an official
<br />
<br /><br />
standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of
<br />
<br /><br />
interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that
<br />
<br /><br />
is widely used among developers working in that language.
<br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
  The "System Libraries" of an executable work include anything, other
<br />
<br /><br />
than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of
<br />
<br /><br />
packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major
<br />
<br /><br />
Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that
<br />
<br /><br />
Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an
<br />
<br /><br />
implementation is available to the public in source code form.  A
<br />
<br /><br />
"Major Component", in this context, means a major essential component
<br />
<br /><br />
(kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system
<br />
<br /><br />
(if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to
<br />
<br /><br />
produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.
<br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
  The "Corresponding Source" for a work in object code form means all
<br />
<br /><br />
the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable
<br />
<br /><br />
work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to
<br />
<br /><br />
control those activities.  However, it does not include the work's
<br />
<br /><br />
System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free
<br />
<br /><br />
programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but
<br />
<br /><br />
which are not part of the work.  For example, Corresponding Source
<br />
<br /><br />
includes interface definition files associated with source files for
<br />
<br /><br />
the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically
<br />
<br /><br />
linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,
<br />
<br /><br />
such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those
<br />
<br /><br />
subprograms and other parts of the work.
<br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
  The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users
<br />
<br /><br />
can regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding
<br />
<br /><br />
Source.
<br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
  The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that
<br />
<br /><br />
same work.
<br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
  2. Basic Permissions.
<br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
  All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of
<br />
<br /><br />
copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated
<br />
<br /><br />
conditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited
<br />
<br /><br />
permission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running a
<br />
<br /><br />
covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its
<br />
<br /><br />
content, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges your
<br />
<br /><br />
rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.
<br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
  You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not
<br />
<br /><br />
convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains
<br />
<br /><br />
in force.  You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose
<br />
<br /><br />
of having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you
<br />
<br /><br />
with facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with
<br />
<br /><br />
the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do
<br />
<br /><br />
not control copyright.  Those thus making or running the covered works
<br />
<br /><br />
for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction
<br />
<br /><br />
and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of
<br />
<br /><br />
your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.
<br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
  Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under
<br />
<br /><br />
the conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10
<br />
<br /><br />
makes it unnecessary.
<br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
  3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.
<br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
  No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological
<br />
<br /><br />
measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article
<br />
<br /><br />
11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or
<br />
<br /><br />
similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such
<br />
<br /><br />
measures.
<br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
  When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid
<br />
<br /><br />
circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention
<br />
<br /><br />
is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to
<br />
<br /><br />
the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or
<br />
<br /><br />
modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's
<br />
<br /><br />
users, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of
<br />
<br /><br />
technological measures.
<br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
  4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.
<br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
  You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you
<br />
<br /><br />
receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and
<br />
<br /><br />
appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;
<br />
<br /><br />
keep intact all notices stating that this License and any
<br />
<br /><br />
non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;
<br />
<br /><br />
keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all
<br />
<br /><br />
recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.
<br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
  You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,
<br />
<br /><br />
and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.
<br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
  5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.
<br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
  You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to
<br />
<br /><br />
produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the
<br />
<br /><br />
terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:
<br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
    a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified
<br />
<br /><br />
    it, and giving a relevant date.
<br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
    b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is
<br />
<br /><br />
    released under this License and any conditions added under section
<br />
<br /><br />
    7.  This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to
<br />
<br /><br />
    "keep intact all notices".
<br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
    c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this
<br />
<br /><br />
    License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This
<br />
<br /><br />
    License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7
<br />
<br /><br />
    additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,
<br />
<br /><br />
    regardless of how they are packaged.  This License gives no
<br />
<br /><br />
    permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not
<br />
<br /><br />
    invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.
<br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
    d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display
<br />
<br /><br />
    Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive
<br />
<br /><br />
    interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your
<br />
<br /><br />
    work need not make them do so.
<br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
  A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent
<br />
<br /><br />
works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,
<br />
<br /><br />
and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,
<br />
<br /><br />
in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an
<br />
<br /><br />
"aggregate" if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not
<br />
<br /><br />
used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users
<br />
<br /><br />
beyond what the individual works permit.  Inclusion of a covered work
<br />
<br /><br />
in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other
<br />
<br /><br />
parts of the aggregate.
<br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
  6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.
<br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
  You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms
<br />
<br /><br />
of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the
<br />
<br /><br />
machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,
<br />
<br /><br />
in one of these ways:
<br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
    a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
<br />
<br /><br />
    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the
<br />
<br /><br />
    Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium
<br />
<br /><br />
    customarily used for software interchange.
<br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
    b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
<br />
<br /><br />
    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a
<br />
<br /><br />
    written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as
<br />
<br /><br />
    long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product
<br />
<br /><br />
    model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a
<br />
<br /><br />
    copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the
<br />
<br /><br />
    product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical
<br />
<br /><br />
    medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no
<br />
<br /><br />
    more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this
<br />
<br /><br />
    conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the
<br />
<br /><br />
    Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.
<br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
    c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the
<br />
<br /><br />
    written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This
<br />
<br /><br />
    alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and
<br />
<br /><br />
    only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord
<br />
<br /><br />
    with subsection 6b.
<br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
    d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated
<br />
<br /><br />
    place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the
<br />
<br /><br />
    Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no
<br />
<br /><br />
    further charge.  You need not require recipients to copy the
<br />
<br /><br />
    Corresponding Source along with the object code.  If the place to
<br />
<br /><br />
    copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source
<br />
<br /><br />
    may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)
<br />
<br /><br />
    that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain
<br />
<br /><br />
    clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the
<br />
<br /><br />
    Corresponding Source.  Regardless of what server hosts the
<br />
<br /><br />
    Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is
<br />
<br /><br />
    available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.
<br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
    e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided
<br />
<br /><br />
    you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding
<br />
<br /><br />
    Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no
<br />
<br /><br />
    charge under subsection 6d.
<br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
  A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded
<br />
<br /><br />
from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be
<br />
<br /><br />
included in conveying the object code work.
<br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
  A "User Product" is either (1) a "consumer product", which means any
<br />
<br /><br />
tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,
<br />
<br /><br />
or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation
<br />
<br /><br />
into a dwelling.  In determining whether a product is a consumer product,
<br />
<br /><br />
doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.  For a particular
<br />
<br /><br />
product received by a particular user, "normally used" refers to a
<br />
<br /><br />
typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status
<br />
<br /><br />
of the particular user or of the way in which the particular user
<br />
<br /><br />
actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product.  A product
<br />
<br /><br />
is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial
<br />
<br /><br />
commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent
<br />
<br /><br />
the only significant mode of use of the product.
<br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
  "Installation Information" for a User Product means any methods,
<br />
<br /><br />
procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install
<br />
<br /><br />
and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from
<br />
<br /><br />
a modified version of its Corresponding Source.  The information must
<br />
<br /><br />
suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object
<br />
<br /><br />
code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because
<br />
<br /><br />
modification has been made.
<br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
  If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or
<br />
<br /><br />
specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as
<br />
<br /><br />
part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the
<br />
<br /><br />
User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a
<br />
<br /><br />
fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the
<br />
<br /><br />
Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied
<br />
<br /><br />
by the Installation Information.  But this requirement does not apply
<br />
<br /><br />
if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install
<br />
<br /><br />
modified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has
<br />
<br /><br />
been installed in ROM).
<br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
  The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a
<br />
<br /><br />
requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates
<br />
<br /><br />
for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for
<br />
<br /><br />
the User Product in which it has been modified or installed.  Access to a
<br />
<br /><br />
network may be denied when the modification itself materially and
<br />
<br /><br />
adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and
<br />
<br /><br />
protocols for communication across the network.
<br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
  Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,
<br />
<br /><br />
in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly
<br />
<br /><br />
documented (and with an implementation available to the public in
<br />
<br /><br />
source code form), and must require no special password or key for
<br />
<br /><br />
unpacking, reading or copying.
<br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
  7. Additional Terms.
<br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
  "Additional permissions" are terms that supplement the terms of this
<br />
<br /><br />
License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.
<br />
<br /><br />
Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall
<br />
<br /><br />
be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent
<br />
<br /><br />
that they are valid under applicable law.  If additional permissions
<br />
<br /><br />
apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately
<br />
<br /><br />
under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by
<br />
<br /><br />
this License without regard to the additional permissions.
<br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
  When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option
<br />
<br /><br />
remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of
<br />
<br /><br />
it.  (Additional permissions may be written to require their own
<br />
<br /><br />
removal in certain cases when you modify the work.)  You may place
<br />
<br /><br />
additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,
<br />
<br /><br />
for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.
<br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you
<br />
<br /><br />
add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of
<br />
<br /><br />
that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:
<br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
    a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the
<br />
<br /><br />
    terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or
<br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
    b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or
<br />
<br /><br />
    author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal
<br />
<br /><br />
    Notices displayed by works containing it; or
<br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
    c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or
<br />
<br /><br />
    requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in
<br />
<br /><br />
    reasonable ways as different from the original version; or
<br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
    d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or
<br />
<br /><br />
    authors of the material; or
<br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
    e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some
<br />
<br /><br />
    trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or
<br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
    f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that
<br />
<br /><br />
    material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of
<br />
<br /><br />
    it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for
<br />
<br /><br />
    any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on
<br />
<br /><br />
    those licensors and authors.
<br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
  All other non-permissive additional terms are considered "further
<br />
<br /><br />
restrictions" within the meaning of section 10.  If the Program as you
<br />
<br /><br />
received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is
<br />
<br /><br />
governed by this License along with a term that is a further
<br />
<br /><br />
restriction, you may remove that term.  If a license document contains
<br />
<br /><br />
a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this
<br />
<br /><br />
License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms
<br />
<br /><br />
of that license document, provided that the further restriction does
<br />
<br /><br />
not survive such relicensing or conveying.
<br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
  If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you
<br />
<br /><br />
must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the
<br />
<br /><br />
additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating
<br />
<br /><br />
where to find the applicable terms.
<br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
  Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the
<br />
<br /><br />
form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;
<br />
<br /><br />
the above requirements apply either way.
<br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
  8. Termination.
<br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
  You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly
<br />
<br /><br />
provided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or
<br />
<br /><br />
modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under
<br />
<br /><br />
this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third
<br />
<br /><br />
paragraph of section 11).
<br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
  However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your
<br />
<br /><br />
license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)
<br />
<br /><br />
provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and
<br />
<br /><br />
finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright
<br />
<br /><br />
holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means
<br />
<br /><br />
prior to 60 days after the cessation.
<br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
  Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is
<br />
<br /><br />
reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the
<br />
<br /><br />
violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have
<br />
<br /><br />
received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that
<br />
<br /><br />
copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after
<br />
<br /><br />
your receipt of the notice.
<br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
  Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the
<br />
<br /><br />
licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under
<br />
<br /><br />
this License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently
<br />
<br /><br />
reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same
<br />
<br /><br />
material under section 10.
<br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
  9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.
<br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
  You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or
<br />
<br /><br />
run a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work
<br />
<br /><br />
occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission
<br />
<br /><br />
to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.  However,
<br />
<br /><br />
nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or
<br />
<br /><br />
modify any covered work.  These actions infringe copyright if you do
<br />
<br /><br />
not accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or propagating a
<br />
<br /><br />
covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.
<br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
  10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.
<br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
  Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically
<br />
<br /><br />
receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and
<br />
<br /><br />
propagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not responsible
<br />
<br /><br />
for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.
<br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
  An "entity transaction" is a transaction transferring control of an
<br />
<br /><br />
organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an
<br />
<br /><br />
organization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a covered
<br />
<br /><br />
work results from an entity transaction, each party to that
<br />
<br /><br />
transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever
<br />
<br /><br />
licenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could
<br />
<br /><br />
give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the
<br />
<br /><br />
Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if
<br />
<br /><br />
the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.
<br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
  You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the
<br />
<br /><br />
rights granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you may
<br />
<br /><br />
not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of
<br />
<br /><br />
rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation
<br />
<br /><br />
(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that
<br />
<br /><br />
any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for
<br />
<br /><br />
sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.
<br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
  11. Patents.
<br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
  A "contributor" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this
<br />
<br /><br />
License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.  The
<br />
<br /><br />
work thus licensed is called the contributor's "contributor version".
<br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
  A contributor's "essential patent claims" are all patent claims
<br />
<br /><br />
owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or
<br />
<br /><br />
hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted
<br />
<br /><br />
by this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,
<br />
<br /><br />
but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a
<br />
<br /><br />
consequence of further modification of the contributor version.  For
<br />
<br /><br />
purposes of this definition, "control" includes the right to grant
<br />
<br /><br />
patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of
<br />
<br /><br />
this License.
<br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
  Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free
<br />
<br /><br />
patent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to
<br />
<br /><br />
make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and
<br />
<br /><br />
propagate the contents of its contributor version.
<br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
  In the following three paragraphs, a "patent license" is any express
<br />
<br /><br />
agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent
<br />
<br /><br />
(such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to
<br />
<br /><br />
sue for patent infringement).  To "grant" such a patent license to a
<br />
<br /><br />
party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a
<br />
<br /><br />
patent against the party.
<br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
  If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,
<br />
<br /><br />
and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone
<br />
<br /><br />
to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a
<br />
<br /><br />
publicly available network server or other readily accessible means,
<br />
<br /><br />
then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so
<br />
<br /><br />
available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the
<br />
<br /><br />
patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner
<br />
<br /><br />
consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent
<br />
<br /><br />
license to downstream recipients.  "Knowingly relying" means you have
<br />
<br /><br />
actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the
<br />
<br /><br />
covered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work
<br />
<br /><br />
in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that
<br />
<br /><br />
country that you have reason to believe are valid.
<br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
  If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or
<br />
<br /><br />
arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a
<br />
<br /><br />
covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties
<br />
<br /><br />
receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify
<br />
<br /><br />
or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license
<br />
<br /><br />
you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered
<br />
<br /><br />
work and works based on it.
<br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
  A patent license is "discriminatory" if it does not include within
<br />
<br /><br />
the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is
<br />
<br /><br />
conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are
<br />
<br /><br />
specifically granted under this License.  You may not convey a covered
<br />
<br /><br />
work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is
<br />
<br /><br />
in the business of distributing software, under which you make payment
<br />
<br /><br />
to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying
<br />
<br /><br />
the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the
<br />
<br /><br />
parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory
<br />
<br /><br />
patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work
<br />
<br /><br />
conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily
<br />
<br /><br />
for and in connection with specific products or compilations that
<br />
<br /><br />
contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,
<br />
<br /><br />
or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.
<br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
  Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting
<br />
<br /><br />
any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may
<br />
<br /><br />
otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.
<br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
  12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.
<br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
  If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
<br />
<br /><br />
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
<br />
<br /><br />
excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot convey a
<br />
<br /><br />
covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
<br />
<br /><br />
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may
<br />
<br /><br />
not convey it at all.  For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you
<br />
<br /><br />
to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey
<br />
<br /><br />
the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this
<br />
<br /><br />
License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.
<br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
  13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.
<br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have
<br />
<br /><br />
permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed
<br />
<br /><br />
under version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single
<br />
<br /><br />
combined work, and to convey the resulting work.  The terms of this
<br />
<br /><br />
License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,
<br />
<br /><br />
but the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License,
<br />
<br /><br />
section 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the
<br />
<br /><br />
combination as such.
<br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
  14. Revised Versions of this License.
<br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of
<br />
<br /><br />
the GNU General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will
<br />
<br /><br />
be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
<br />
<br /><br />
address new problems or concerns.
<br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
  Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the
<br />
<br /><br />
Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General
<br />
<br /><br />
Public License "or any later version" applies to it, you have the
<br />
<br /><br />
option of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered
<br />
<br /><br />
version or of any later version published by the Free Software
<br />
<br /><br />
Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of the
<br />
<br /><br />
GNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published
<br />
<br /><br />
by the Free Software Foundation.
<br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
  If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future
<br />
<br /><br />
versions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy's
<br />
<br /><br />
public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you
<br />
<br /><br />
to choose that version for the Program.
<br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
  Later license versions may give you additional or different
<br />
<br /><br />
permissions.  However, no additional obligations are imposed on any
<br />
<br /><br />
author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a
<br />
<br /><br />
later version.
<br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
  15. Disclaimer of Warranty.
<br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
  THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY
<br />
<br /><br />
APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT
<br />
<br /><br />
HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY
<br />
<br /><br />
OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,
<br />
<br /><br />
THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
<br />
<br /><br />
PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM
<br />
<br /><br />
IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF
<br />
<br /><br />
ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
<br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
  16. Limitation of Liability.
<br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
  IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
<br />
<br /><br />
WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS
<br />
<br /><br />
THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY
<br />
<br /><br />
GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE
<br />
<br /><br />
USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF
<br />
<br /><br />
DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD
<br />
<br /><br />
PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS),
<br />
<br /><br />
EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF
<br />
<br /><br />
SUCH DAMAGES.
<br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
  17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.
<br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
  If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided
<br />
<br /><br />
above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,
<br />
<br /><br />
reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates
<br />
<br /><br />
an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the
<br />
<br /><br />
Program, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a
<br />
<br /><br />
copy of the Program in return for a fee.
<br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
<br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
            How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs
<br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
<br />
<br /><br />
possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
<br />
<br /><br />
free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.
<br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest
<br />
<br /><br />
to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
<br />
<br /><br />
state the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
<br />
<br /><br />
the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.
<br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
    <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>
<br />
<br /><br />
    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>
<br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
    This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify
<br />
<br /><br />
    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
<br />
<br /><br />
    the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or
<br />
<br /><br />
    (at your option) any later version.
<br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
<br />
<br /><br />
    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
<br />
<br /><br />
    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the
<br />
<br /><br />
    GNU General Public License for more details.
<br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
<br />
<br /><br />
    along with this program.  If not, see <http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.
<br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.
<br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
  If the program does terminal interaction, make it output a short
<br />
<br /><br />
notice like this when it starts in an interactive mode:
<br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
    <program>  Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>
<br />
<br /><br />
    This program comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.
<br />
<br /><br />
    This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it
<br />
<br /><br />
    under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.
<br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate
<br />
<br /><br />
parts of the General Public License.  Of course, your program's commands
<br />
<br /><br />
might be different; for a GUI interface, you would use an "about box".
<br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
  You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school,
<br />
<br /><br />
if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if necessary.
<br />
<br /><br />
For more information on this, and how to apply and follow the GNU GPL, see
<br />

<http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.
<br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
  The GNU General Public License does not permit incorporating your program
<br />
<br /><br />
into proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you
<br />
<br /><br />
may consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with
<br />
<br /><br />
the library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General
<br />
<br /><br />
Public License instead of this License.  But first, please read

            GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
<br />
<br /><br />
                Version 3, 29 June 2007
<br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
 Copyright � 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <http://fsf.org/>
<br />
<br /><br />
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this
<br />
<br /><br />
 license document, but changing it is not allowed.
<br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
This version of the GNU Lesser General Public License incorporates
<br />
<br /><br />
the terms and conditions of version 3 of the GNU General Public
<br />
<br /><br />
License, supplemented by the additional permissions listed below.
<br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
0. Additional Definitions.
<br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
 As used herein, �this License� refers to version 3 of the GNU Lesser
<br />
<br /><br />
General Public License, and the �GNU GPL� refers to version 3 of the
<br />
<br /><br />
GNU General Public License.
<br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
 �The Library� refers to a covered work governed by this License,
<br />
<br /><br />
other than an Application or a Combined Work as defined below.
<br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
 An �Application� is any work that makes use of an interface provided
<br />
<br /><br />
by the Library, but which is not otherwise based on the Library.
<br />
<br /><br />
Defining a subclass of a class defined by the Library is deemed a mode
<br />
<br /><br />
of using an interface provided by the Library.
<br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
 A �Combined Work� is a work produced by combining or linking an
<br />
<br /><br />
Application with the Library. The particular version of the Library
<br />
<br /><br />
with which the Combined Work was made is also called the �Linked
<br />
<br /><br />
Version�.
<br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
 The �Minimal Corresponding Source� for a Combined Work means the
<br />
<br /><br />
Corresponding Source for the Combined Work, excluding any source code
<br />
<br /><br />
for portions of the Combined Work that, considered in isolation, are
<br />
<br /><br />
based on the Application, and not on the Linked Version.
<br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
 The �Corresponding Application Code� for a Combined Work means the
<br />
<br /><br />
object code and/or source code for the Application, including any data
<br />
<br /><br />
and utility programs needed for reproducing the Combined Work from the
<br />
<br /><br />
Application, but excluding the System Libraries of the Combined Work.
<br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
1. Exception to Section 3 of the GNU GPL.
<br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
 You may convey a covered work under sections 3 and 4 of this License
<br />
<br /><br />
without being bound by section 3 of the GNU GPL.
<br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
2. Conveying Modified Versions.
<br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
 If you modify a copy of the Library, and, in your modifications, a
<br />
<br /><br />
facility refers to a function or data to be supplied by an Application
<br />
<br /><br />
that uses the facility (other than as an argument passed when the
<br />
<br /><br />
facility is invoked), then you may convey a copy of the modified
<br />
<br /><br />
version:
<br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
    a) under this License, provided that you make a good faith effort
<br />
<br /><br />
    to ensure that, in the event an Application does not supply the
<br />
<br /><br />
    function or data, the facility still operates, and performs
<br />
<br /><br />
    whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful, or
<br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
    b) under the GNU GPL, with none of the additional permissions of
<br />
<br /><br />
    this License applicable to that copy.
<br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
3. Object Code Incorporating Material from Library Header Files.
<br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
 The object code form of an Application may incorporate material from
<br />
<br /><br />
a header file that is part of the Library. You may convey such object
<br />
<br /><br />
code under terms of your choice, provided that, if the incorporated
<br />
<br /><br />
material is not limited to numerical parameters, data structure
<br />
<br /><br />
layouts and accessors, or small macros, inline functions and templates
<br />
<br /><br />
(ten or fewer lines in length), you do both of the following:
<br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
    a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the object code that
<br />
<br /><br />
    the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are
<br />
<br /><br />
    covered by this License.
<br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
    b) Accompany the object code with a copy of the GNU GPL and this
<br />
<br /><br />
    license document.
<br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
4. Combined Works.
<br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
 You may convey a Combined Work under terms of your choice that, taken
<br />
<br /><br />
together, effectively do not restrict modification of the portions of
<br />
<br /><br />
the Library contained in the Combined Work and reverse engineering for
<br />
<br /><br />
debugging such modifications, if you also do each of the following:
<br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
    a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the Combined Work that
<br />
<br /><br />
    the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are
<br />
<br /><br />
    covered by this License.
<br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
    b) Accompany the Combined Work with a copy of the GNU GPL and this
<br />
<br /><br />
    license document.
<br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
    c) For a Combined Work that displays copyright notices during
<br />
<br /><br />
    execution, include the copyright notice for the Library among
<br />
<br /><br />
    these notices, as well as a reference directing the user to the
<br />
<br /><br />
    copies of the GNU GPL and this license document.
<br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
    d) Do one of the following:
<br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
        0) Convey the Minimal Corresponding Source under the terms of
<br />
<br /><br />
        this License, and the Corresponding Application Code in a form
<br />
<br /><br />
        suitable for, and under terms that permit, the user to
<br />
<br /><br />
        recombine or relink the Application with a modified version of
<br />
<br /><br />
        the Linked Version to produce a modified Combined Work, in the
<br />
<br /><br />
        manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying
<br />
<br /><br />
        Corresponding Source.
<br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
        1) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with
<br />
<br /><br />
        the Library. A suitable mechanism is one that (a) uses at run
<br />
<br /><br />
        time a copy of the Library already present on the user's
<br />
<br /><br />
        computer system, and (b) will operate properly with a modified
<br />
<br /><br />
        version of the Library that is interface-compatible with the
<br />
<br /><br />
        Linked Version.
<br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
    e) Provide Installation Information, but only if you would
<br />
<br /><br />
    otherwise be required to provide such information under section 6
<br />
<br /><br />
    of the GNU GPL, and only to the extent that such information is
<br />
<br /><br />
    necessary to install and execute a modified version of the
<br />
<br /><br />
    Combined Work produced by recombining or relinking the Application
<br />
<br /><br />
    with a modified version of the Linked Version. (If you use option
<br />
<br /><br />
    4d0, the Installation Information must accompany the Minimal
<br />
<br /><br />
    Corresponding Source and Corresponding Application Code. If you
<br />
<br /><br />
    use option 4d1, you must provide the Installation Information in
<br />
<br /><br />
    the manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying
<br />
<br /><br />
    Corresponding Source.)

5. Combined Libraries.
<br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
 You may place library facilities that are a work based on the Library
<br />
<br /><br />
side by side in a single library together with other library
<br />
<br /><br />
facilities that are not Applications and are not covered by this
<br />
<br /><br />
License, and convey such a combined library under terms of your
<br />
<br /><br />
choice, if you do both of the following:
<br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
    a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work
<br />
<br /><br />
    based on the Library, uncombined with any other library
<br />
<br /><br />
    facilities, conveyed under the terms of this License.
<br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
    b) Give prominent notice with the combined library that part of
<br />
<br /><br />
    it is a work based on the Library, and explaining where to find
<br />
<br /><br />
    the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.
<br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
6. Revised Versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License.
<br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
 The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
<br />
<br /><br />
of the GNU Lesser General Public License from time to time. Such new
<br />
<br /><br />
versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
<br />
<br /><br />
differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.
<br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Library
<br />
<br /><br />
as you received it specifies that a certain numbered version of the
<br />
<br /><br />
GNU Lesser General Public License �or any later version� applies to
<br />
<br /><br />
it, you have the option of following the terms and conditions either
<br />
<br /><br />
of that published version or of any later version published by the
<br />
<br /><br />
Free Software Foundation. If the Library as you received it does not
<br />
<br /><br />
specify a version number of the GNU Lesser General Public License,
<br />
<br /><br />
you may choose any version of the GNU Lesser General Public License
<br />
<br /><br />
ever published by the Free Software Foundation.
<br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
If the Library as you received it specifies that a proxy can decide
<br />
<br /><br />
whether future versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License shall
<br />
<br /><br />
apply, that proxy's public statement of acceptance of any version is
<br />
<br /><br />
permanent authorization for you to choose that version for the Library.

<br />
Parts of the FreeType projects have been modified and put into Qt for use in the painting subsystem. These files are ftraster.h, ftraster.c, ftgrays.h and ftgrays.c. The following modifications has been made to these files:
<br />
Renamed FT_ and ft_ symbols to QT_FT_ and qt_ft_ to avoid name conflicts.
<br />
Removed parts of code not relevant when compiled with _STANDALONE_ defined.
<br />
Changed behavior in ftraster.c to follow X polygon filling rules.
<br />
Implemented support in ftraster.c for winding / odd even polygon fill rules.
<br />
Replaced bitmap generation with span generation in ftraster.c
<br />
Renamed: ftraster.h to qblackraster_p.h
<br />
Renamed: ftraster.c to qblackraster.c
<br />
Renamed: ftgrays.h to qgrayraster_p.h
<br />
Renamed: ftgrays.c to qgrayraster.c

Introduction
<br />
============
<br />
<br /><br />
The FreeType Project is distributed in several archive packages; some of them may contain, in addition to the FreeType font engine, various tools and contributions which rely on, or relate to, the FreeType Project.
<br />
<br /><br />
This license applies to all files found in such packages, and which do not fall under their own explicit license.  The license affects thus the FreeType font engine, the test programs,documentation and makefiles, at the very least.
<br />
<br /><br />
This license was inspired by the BSD, Artistic, and IJG (Independent JPEG  Group) licenses, which all encourage inclusion and use of  free software in  commercial and freeware products alike. As a consequence, its main points are that:
<br />
    o We don't promise that this software works. However, we will be interested in any kind of bug reports. (`as is' distribution)
<br />
<br /><br />
    o You can use this software for whatever you want, in parts or full form, without having to pay us. (`royalty-free' usage)
<br />
<br /><br />
    o You may not pretend that you wrote this software.  If you use it, or only parts of it, in a program, you must acknowledge somewhere in your documentation  that you have used the FreeType code. (`credits')
<br />
<br /><br />
We specifically permit and encourage the inclusion of this software, with  or without modifications, in commercial products.  We disclaim all warranties covering The FreeType Project and assume no liability related to The FreeType Project.
<br />
<br /><br />
Finally, many people asked us for  a preferred form  for a credit/disclaimer to use in compliance with this license.  We thus encourage you to use the following text:
<br />
    �Portions of this software are copyright � <year> The FreeType Project (www.freetype.org).  All rights reserved."
<br />
<br /><br />
  Please replace <year> with the value from the FreeType version you actually use.
<br />
<br /><br />
Legal Terms
<br />
===========
<br />
<br /><br />
0. Definitions
<br />
--------------
<br />
Throughout this license, the terms `package', `FreeType Project', and `FreeType archive' refer to the set of files originally distributed by the authors (David Turner, Robert Wilhelm, and  Werner Lemberg) as the `FreeType Project', be they named as alpha, beta or final release.
<br />
<br /><br />
`You' refers to the licensee, or person using the project, where `using' is a generic term including compiling the project's source code as well as linking it to form a `program' or `executable'.  This program is referred to as `a program  using the FreeType engine'.
<br />
<br /><br />
This license applies to all files distributed in the original FreeType Project, including all source code, binaries and documentation, unless otherwise stated in the file in its original, unmodified form as distributed in the original archive. If you are unsure whether or not a particular file is covered by this license, you must contact us to verify this.
<br />
<br /><br />
The FreeType Project is copyright (C) 1996-2000 by David Turner, Robert Wilhelm, and Werner Lemberg.  All rights reserved except as specified below.
<br />
<br /><br />
1. No Warranty
<br />
--------------
<br />
THE FREETYPE PROJECT IS PROVIDED `AS IS' WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  IN NO EVENT WILL ANY OF THE AUTHORS OR COPYRIGHT HOLDERS BE LIABLE FOR ANY DAMAGES CAUSED BY THE USE OR THE INABILITY TO USE, OF THE FREETYPE PROJECT.
<br />
<br /><br />
2. Redistribution
<br />
-----------------
<br />
This license grants a worldwide, royalty-free, perpetual and irrevocable right and license to use,  execute, perform, compile, display, copy, create derivative works of, distribute and sublicense the FreeType Project (in both source and object code forms) and derivative works thereof for any purpose; and to authorize others to exercise some or all of the rights granted herein, subject to the following conditions:
<br />
<br /><br />
    o Redistribution of  source code must retain this license file (`FTL.TXT') unaltered; any additions, deletions or changes to the original files must be clearly  indicated in accompanying documentation.  The copyright notices of the unaltered, original files must be preserved in all copies of source files.
<br />
<br /><br />
    o Redistribution in binary form must provide a disclaimer that states that the software is based in part of the work of the FreeType Team, in the distribution documentation.  We also encourage you to put an URL to the FreeType web page in your documentation, though this isn't mandatory.
<br />
<br /><br />
These conditions apply to any software derived from or based on the FreeType Project, not just the unmodified files. If you use our work, you must acknowledge us.  However, no fee need be paid to us.
<br />
<br /><br />
3. Advertising
<br />
--------------
<br />
Neither the FreeType authors and contributors nor you shall use the name of the other for commercial, advertising, or promotional purposes without specific prior written permission. We suggest, but do not require, that you use one or more of the following phrases to refer  to this software in your documentation or advertising materials: `FreeType Project', `FreeType Engine', `FreeType library', or `FreeType Distribution'.
<br />
<br /><br />
As you have not signed this license, you are not required to accept it.  However, as the FreeType Project is copyrighted material, only  this license, or another one contracted with the authors, grants you the right to use, distribute, and modify it.  Therefore, by using, distributing, or modifying the FreeType Project, you indicate that you understand and accept all the terms of this license.
<br />
<br /><br />
4. Contacts
<br />
-----------
<br />
  There are two mailing lists related to FreeType:
<br />
    o freetype@nongnu.org
<br />
Discusses general use and applications of FreeType, as well as future and wanted additions to the library and distribution. If you are looking for support, start in this list if you haven't found anything to help you in the documentation.
<br />
<br /><br />
    o freetype-devel@nongnu.org
<br />
Discusses bugs, as well as engine internals, design issues, specific licenses, porting, etc.

<br />
2. You can use this software for whatever you want.  You don't have to pay us.

<br />
All Rights Reserved except as specified below.
<br />
Permission is hereby granted to use, copy, modify, and distribute this software (or portions thereof) for any purpose, without fee, subject to these conditions:
<br />
(1) If any part of the source code for this software is distributed, then this README file must be included, with this copyright and no-warranty notice unaltered; and any additions, deletions, or changes to the original files must be clearly indicated in accompanying documentation.
<br />
(2) If only executable code is distributed, then the accompanying
<br />
documentation must state that "this software is based in part on the work of the Independent JPEG Group".
<br />
(3) Permission for use of this software is granted only if the user accepts full responsibility for any undesirable consequences; the authors accept NO LIABILITY for damages of any kind.
<br />
These conditions apply to any software derived from or based on the IJG code, not just to the unmodified library.  If you use our work, you ought to acknowledge us.
<br />
Permission is NOT granted for the use of any IJG author's name or company name in advertising or publicity relating to this software or products derived from it.  This software may be referred to only as "the Independent JPEG Group's software".
<br />
We specifically permit and encourage the use of this software as the basis of commercial products, provided that all warranty or liability claims are assumed by the product vendor.
<br />
ansi2knr.c is included in this distribution by permission of L. Peter Deutsch, sole proprietor of its copyright holder, Aladdin Enterprises of Menlo Park, CA. ansi2knr.c is NOT covered by the above copyright and conditions, but instead by the usual distribution terms of the Free Software Foundation; principally,that you must include source code if you redistribute it.  (See the file ansi2knr.c for full details.)  However, since ansi2knr.c is not needed as part of any program generated from the IJG code, this does not limit you more than the foregoing paragraphs do.
<br />
The Unix configuration script "configure" was produced with GNU Autoconf. It is copyright by the Free Software Foundation but is freely distributable. The same holds for its supporting scripts (config.guess, config.sub,
<br />
ltconfig, ltmain.sh).  Another support script, install-sh, is copyright by M.I.T. but is also freely distributable.
<br />
It appears that the arithmetic coding option of the JPEG spec is covered by patents owned by IBM, AT&T, and Mitsubishi.  Hence arithmetic coding cannot legally be used without obtaining one or more licenses.  For this reason, support for arithmetic coding has been removed from the free JPEG software.
<br />
(Since arithmetic coding provides only a marginal gain over the unpatented Huffman mode, it is unlikely that very many implementations will support it.)
<br />
So far as we are aware, there are no patent restrictions on the remaining code.
<br />
The IJG distribution formerly included code to read and write GIF files.
<br />
To avoid entanglement with the Unisys LZW patent, GIF reading support has been removed altogether, and the GIF writer has been simplified to produce "uncompressed GIFs".  This technique does not use the LZW algorithm; the resulting GIF files are larger than usual, but are readable by all standard GIF decoders.

Bison Parser

As a special exception, you may create a larger work that contains part or all of the Bison parser skeleton and distribute that work under terms of your choice, so long as that work isn't itself a parser generator using the skeleton or a modified version thereof as a parser skeleton. Alternatively, if you modify or redistribute the parser skeleton itself, you may (at your option) remove this special exception, which will cause the skeleton and the resulting Bison output files to be licensed under the GNU General Public License without this special exception.

PCRE LICENSE
<br />
------------
<br />
<br /><br />
PCRE is a library of functions to support regular expressions whose syntax
<br />
and semantics are as close as possible to those of the Perl 5 language.
<br />
<br /><br />
Release 8 of PCRE is distributed under the terms of the "BSD" license, as
<br />
specified below. The documentation for PCRE, supplied in the "doc"
<br />
directory, is distributed under the same terms as the software itself.
<br />
<br /><br />
The basic library functions are written in C and are freestanding. Also
<br />
included in the distribution is a set of C++ wrapper functions, and a
<br />
just-in-time compiler that can be used to optimize pattern matching. These
<br />
are both optional features that can be omitted when the library is built.
<br />

   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION
<br />
<br /><br />
   1. Definitions.
<br />
<br /><br />
      "License" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,
<br />
      and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.
<br />
<br /><br />
      "Licensor" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by
<br />
      the copyright owner that is granting the License.
<br />
<br /><br />
      "Legal Entity" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all
<br />
      other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
<br />
      control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,
<br />
      "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
<br />
      direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
<br />
      otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
<br />
      outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.
<br />
<br /><br />
      "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
<br />
      exercising permissions granted by this License.
<br />
<br /><br />
      "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
<br />
      including but not limited to software source code, documentation
<br />
      source, and configuration files.
<br />
<br /><br />
      "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
<br />
      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
<br />
      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
<br />
      and conversions to other media types.
<br />
<br /><br />
      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
<br />
      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
<br />
      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
<br />
      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).
<br />
<br /><br />
      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
<br />
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
<br />
      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
<br />
      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
<br />
      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
<br />
      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
<br />
      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
<br />
<br /><br />
      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
<br />
      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
<br />
      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
<br />
      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
<br />
      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
<br />
      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
<br />
      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
<br />
      to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
<br />
      communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
<br />
      and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
<br />
      Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
<br />
      excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
<br />
      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."
<br />
<br /><br />
      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
<br />
      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
<br />
      subsequently incorporated within the Work.
<br />
<br /><br />
   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
<br />
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
<br />
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
<br />
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
<br />
      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
<br />
      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
<br />
<br /><br />
   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
<br />
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
<br />
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
<br />
      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
<br />
      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
<br />
      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
<br />
      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
<br />
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
<br />
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
<br />
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
<br />
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
<br />
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
<br />
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
<br />
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
<br />
      as of the date such litigation is filed.
<br />
<br /><br />
   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
<br />
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
<br />
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
<br />
      meet the following conditions:
<br />
<br /><br />
      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
<br />
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
<br />
<br /><br />
      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
<br />
          stating that You changed the files; and
<br />
<br /><br />
      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
<br />
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
<br />
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
<br />
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
<br />
          the Derivative Works; and
<br />
<br /><br />
      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
<br />
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
<br />
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
<br />
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
<br />
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
<br />
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
<br />
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
<br />
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
<br />
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
<br />
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
<br />
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
<br />
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
<br />
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
<br />
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
<br />
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
<br />
          as modifying the License.
<br />
<br /><br />
      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
<br />
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
<br />
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
<br />
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
<br />
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
<br />
      the conditions stated in this License.
<br />
<br /><br />
   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
<br />
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
<br />
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
<br />
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
<br />
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
<br />
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
<br />
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
<br />
<br /><br />
   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
<br />
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
<br />
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
<br />
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
<br />
<br /><br />
   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
<br />
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
<br />
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
<br />
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
<br />
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
<br />
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
<br />
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
<br />
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
<br />
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
<br />
<br /><br />
   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
<br />
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
<br />
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
<br />
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
<br />
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
<br />
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
<br />
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
<br />
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
<br />
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
<br />
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
<br />
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
<br />
<br /><br />
   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
<br />
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
<br />
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
<br />
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
<br />
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
<br />
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
<br />
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
<br />
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
<br />
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
<br />
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
<br />
<br /><br />
   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

		   GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
<br />
                       Version 3, 29 June 2007
<br />
<br /><br />
 Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <http://fsf.org/>
<br />
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
<br />
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
<br />
<br /><br />
<br /><br />
  This version of the GNU Lesser General Public License incorporates
<br />
the terms and conditions of version 3 of the GNU General Public
<br />
License, supplemented by the additional permissions listed below.
<br />
<br /><br />
  0. Additional Definitions. 
<br />
<br /><br />
  As used herein, "this License" refers to version 3 of the GNU Lesser
<br />
General Public License, and the "GNU GPL" refers to version 3 of the GNU
<br />
General Public License.
<br />
<br /><br />
  "The Library" refers to a covered work governed by this License,
<br />
other than an Application or a Combined Work as defined below.
<br />
<br /><br />
  An "Application" is any work that makes use of an interface provided
<br />
by the Library, but which is not otherwise based on the Library.
<br />
Defining a subclass of a class defined by the Library is deemed a mode
<br />
of using an interface provided by the Library.
<br />
<br /><br />
  A "Combined Work" is a work produced by combining or linking an
<br />
Application with the Library.  The particular version of the Library
<br />
with which the Combined Work was made is also called the "Linked
<br />
Version".
<br />
<br /><br />
  The "Minimal Corresponding Source" for a Combined Work means the
<br />
Corresponding Source for the Combined Work, excluding any source code
<br />
for portions of the Combined Work that, considered in isolation, are
<br />
based on the Application, and not on the Linked Version.
<br />
<br /><br />
  The "Corresponding Application Code" for a Combined Work means the
<br />
object code and/or source code for the Application, including any data
<br />
and utility programs needed for reproducing the Combined Work from the
<br />
Application, but excluding the System Libraries of the Combined Work.
<br />
<br /><br />
  1. Exception to Section 3 of the GNU GPL.
<br />
<br /><br />
  You may convey a covered work under sections 3 and 4 of this License
<br />
without being bound by section 3 of the GNU GPL.
<br />
<br /><br />
  2. Conveying Modified Versions.
<br />
<br /><br />
  If you modify a copy of the Library, and, in your modifications, a
<br />
facility refers to a function or data to be supplied by an Application
<br />
that uses the facility (other than as an argument passed when the
<br />
facility is invoked), then you may convey a copy of the modified
<br />
version:
<br />
<br /><br />
   a) under this License, provided that you make a good faith effort to
<br />
   ensure that, in the event an Application does not supply the
<br />
   function or data, the facility still operates, and performs
<br />
   whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful, or
<br />
<br /><br />
   b) under the GNU GPL, with none of the additional permissions of
<br />
   this License applicable to that copy.
<br />
<br /><br />
  3. Object Code Incorporating Material from Library Header Files.
<br />
<br /><br />
  The object code form of an Application may incorporate material from
<br />
a header file that is part of the Library.  You may convey such object
<br />
code under terms of your choice, provided that, if the incorporated
<br />
material is not limited to numerical parameters, data structure
<br />
layouts and accessors, or small macros, inline functions and templates
<br />
(ten or fewer lines in length), you do both of the following:
<br />
<br /><br />
   a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the object code that the
<br />
   Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are
<br />
   covered by this License.
<br />
<br /><br />
   b) Accompany the object code with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license
<br />
   document.
<br />
<br /><br />
  4. Combined Works.
<br />
<br /><br />
  You may convey a Combined Work under terms of your choice that,
<br />
taken together, effectively do not restrict modification of the
<br />
portions of the Library contained in the Combined Work and reverse
<br />
engineering for debugging such modifications, if you also do each of
<br />
the following:
<br />
<br /><br />
   a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the Combined Work that
<br />
   the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are
<br />
   covered by this License.
<br />
<br /><br />
   b) Accompany the Combined Work with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license
<br />
   document.
<br />
<br /><br />
   c) For a Combined Work that displays copyright notices during
<br />
   execution, include the copyright notice for the Library among
<br />
   these notices, as well as a reference directing the user to the
<br />
   copies of the GNU GPL and this license document.
<br />
<br /><br />
   d) Do one of the following:
<br />
<br /><br />
       0) Convey the Minimal Corresponding Source under the terms of this
<br />
       License, and the Corresponding Application Code in a form
<br />
       suitable for, and under terms that permit, the user to
<br />
       recombine or relink the Application with a modified version of
<br />
       the Linked Version to produce a modified Combined Work, in the
<br />
       manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying
<br />
       Corresponding Source.
<br />
<br /><br />
       1) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the
<br />
       Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (a) uses at run time
<br />
       a copy of the Library already present on the user's computer
<br />
       system, and (b) will operate properly with a modified version
<br />
       of the Library that is interface-compatible with the Linked
<br />
       Version. 
<br />
<br /><br />
   e) Provide Installation Information, but only if you would otherwise
<br />
   be required to provide such information under section 6 of the
<br />
   GNU GPL, and only to the extent that such information is
<br />
   necessary to install and execute a modified version of the
<br />
   Combined Work produced by recombining or relinking the
<br />
   Application with a modified version of the Linked Version. (If
<br />
   you use option 4d0, the Installation Information must accompany
<br />
   the Minimal Corresponding Source and Corresponding Application
<br />
   Code. If you use option 4d1, you must provide the Installation
<br />
   Information in the manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL
<br />
   for conveying Corresponding Source.)
<br />
<br /><br />
  5. Combined Libraries.
<br />
<br /><br />
  You may place library facilities that are a work based on the
<br />
Library side by side in a single library together with other library
<br />
facilities that are not Applications and are not covered by this
<br />
License, and convey such a combined library under terms of your
<br />
choice, if you do both of the following:
<br />
<br /><br />
   a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based
<br />
   on the Library, uncombined with any other library facilities,
<br />
   conveyed under the terms of this License.
<br />
<br /><br />
   b) Give prominent notice with the combined library that part of it
<br />
   is a work based on the Library, and explaining where to find the
<br />
   accompanying uncombined form of the same work.
<br />
<br /><br />
  6. Revised Versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License.
<br />
<br /><br />
  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
<br />
of the GNU Lesser General Public License from time to time. Such new
<br />
versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
<br />
differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.
<br />
<br /><br />
  Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the
<br />
Library as you received it specifies that a certain numbered version
<br />
of the GNU Lesser General Public License "or any later version"
<br />
applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and
<br />
conditions either of that published version or of any later version
<br />
published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Library as you
<br />
received it does not specify a version number of the GNU Lesser
<br />
General Public License, you may choose any version of the GNU Lesser
<br />
General Public License ever published by the Free Software Foundation.
<br />
<br /><br />
  If the Library as you received it specifies that a proxy can decide
<br />
whether future versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License shall
<br />
apply, that proxy's public statement of acceptance of any version is
<br />
permanent authorization for you to choose that version for the
<br />
Library.
<br />
<br /><br />

GCC RUNTIME LIBRARY EXCEPTION
<br />
<br /><br />
Version 3.1, 31 March 2009
<br />
<br /><br />
Copyright (C) 2009 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <http://fsf.org/>
<br />
<br /><br />
Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this
<br />
license document, but changing it is not allowed.
<br />
<br /><br />
This GCC Runtime Library Exception ("Exception") is an additional
<br />
permission under section 7 of the GNU General Public License, version
<br />
3 ("GPLv3"). It applies to a given file (the "Runtime Library") that
<br />
bears a notice placed by the copyright holder of the file stating that
<br />
the file is governed by GPLv3 along with this Exception.
<br />
<br /><br />
When you use GCC to compile a program, GCC may combine portions of
<br />
certain GCC header files and runtime libraries with the compiled
<br />
program. The purpose of this Exception is to allow compilation of
<br />
non-GPL (including proprietary) programs to use, in this way, the
<br />
header files and runtime libraries covered by this Exception.
<br />
<br /><br />
0. Definitions.
<br />
<br /><br />
A file is an "Independent Module" if it either requires the Runtime
<br />
Library for execution after a Compilation Process, or makes use of an
<br />
interface provided by the Runtime Library, but is not otherwise based
<br />
on the Runtime Library.
<br />
<br /><br />
"GCC" means a version of the GNU Compiler Collection, with or without
<br />
modifications, governed by version 3 (or a specified later version) of
<br />
the GNU General Public License (GPL) with the option of using any
<br />
subsequent versions published by the FSF.
<br />
<br /><br />
"GPL-compatible Software" is software whose conditions of propagation,
<br />
modification and use would permit combination with GCC in accord with
<br />
the license of GCC.
<br />
<br /><br />
"Target Code" refers to output from any compiler for a real or virtual
<br />
target processor architecture, in executable form or suitable for
<br />
input to an assembler, loader, linker and/or execution
<br />
phase. Notwithstanding that, Target Code does not include data in any
<br />
format that is used as a compiler intermediate representation, or used
<br />
for producing a compiler intermediate representation.
<br />
<br /><br />
The "Compilation Process" transforms code entirely represented in
<br />
non-intermediate languages designed for human-written code, and/or in
<br />
Java Virtual Machine byte code, into Target Code. Thus, for example,
<br />
use of source code generators and preprocessors need not be considered
<br />
part of the Compilation Process, since the Compilation Process can be
<br />
understood as starting with the output of the generators or
<br />
preprocessors.
<br />
<br /><br />
A Compilation Process is "Eligible" if it is done using GCC, alone or
<br />
with other GPL-compatible software, or if it is done without using any
<br />
work based on GCC. For example, using non-GPL-compatible Software to
<br />
optimize any GCC intermediate representations would not qualify as an
<br />
Eligible Compilation Process.
<br />
<br /><br />
1. Grant of Additional Permission.
<br />
<br /><br />
You have permission to propagate a work of Target Code formed by
<br />
combining the Runtime Library with Independent Modules, even if such
<br />
propagation would otherwise violate the terms of GPLv3, provided that
<br />
all Target Code was generated by Eligible Compilation Processes. You
<br />
may then convey such a combination under terms of your choice,
<br />
consistent with the licensing of the Independent Modules.
<br />
<br /><br />
2. No Weakening of GCC Copyleft.
<br />
<br /><br />
The availability of this Exception does not imply any general
<br />
presumption that third-party software is unaffected by the copyleft
<br />
requirements of the license of GCC.

                    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
<br />
                       Version 3, 29 June 2007
<br />
<br /><br />
 Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <http://fsf.org/>
<br />
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
<br />
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
<br />
<br /><br />
                            Preamble
<br />
<br /><br />
  The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for
<br />
software and other kinds of works.
<br />
<br /><br />
  The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed
<br />
to take away your freedom to share and change the works.  By contrast,
<br />
the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to
<br />
share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free
<br />
software for all its users.  We, the Free Software Foundation, use the
<br />
GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to
<br />
any other work released this way by its authors.  You can apply it to
<br />
your programs, too.
<br />
<br /><br />
  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
<br />
price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
<br />
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
<br />
them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you
<br />
want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new
<br />
free programs, and that you know you can do these things.
<br />
<br /><br />
  To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you
<br />
these rights or asking you to surrender the rights.  Therefore, you have
<br />
certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if
<br />
you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.
<br />
<br /><br />
  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
<br />
gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same
<br />
freedoms that you received.  You must make sure that they, too, receive
<br />
or can get the source code.  And you must show them these terms so they
<br />
know their rights.
<br />
<br /><br />
  Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:
<br />
(1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License
<br />
giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.
<br />
<br /><br />
  For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains
<br />
that there is no warranty for this free software.  For both users' and
<br />
authors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as
<br />
changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to
<br />
authors of previous versions.
<br />
<br /><br />
  Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run
<br />
modified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer
<br />
can do so.  This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of
<br />
protecting users' freedom to change the software.  The systematic
<br />
pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to
<br />
use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable.  Therefore, we
<br />
have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those
<br />
products.  If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we
<br />
stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions
<br />
of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.
<br />
<br /><br />
  Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.
<br />
States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of
<br />
software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to
<br />
avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could
<br />
make it effectively proprietary.  To prevent this, the GPL assures that
<br />
patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.
<br />
<br /><br />
  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
<br />
modification follow.
<br />
<br /><br />
                       TERMS AND CONDITIONS
<br />
<br /><br />
  0. Definitions.
<br />
<br /><br />
  "This License" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.
<br />
<br /><br />
  "Copyright" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of
<br />
works, such as semiconductor masks.
<br />
<br /><br />
  "The Program" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this
<br />
License.  Each licensee is addressed as "you".  "Licensees" and
<br />
"recipients" may be individuals or organizations.
<br />
<br /><br />
  To "modify" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work
<br />
in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an
<br />
exact copy.  The resulting work is called a "modified version" of the
<br />
earlier work or a work "based on" the earlier work.
<br />
<br /><br />
  A "covered work" means either the unmodified Program or a work based
<br />
on the Program.
<br />
<br /><br />
  To "propagate" a work means to do anything with it that, without
<br />
permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for
<br />
infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a
<br />
computer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes copying,
<br />
distribution (with or without modification), making available to the
<br />
public, and in some countries other activities as well.
<br />
<br /><br />
  To "convey" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other
<br />
parties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user through
<br />
a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.
<br />
<br /><br />
  An interactive user interface displays "Appropriate Legal Notices"
<br />
to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible
<br />
feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)
<br />
tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the
<br />
extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the
<br />
work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.  If
<br />
the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a
<br />
menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.
<br />
<br /><br />
  1. Source Code.
<br />
<br /><br />
  The "source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work
<br />
for making modifications to it.  "Object code" means any non-source
<br />
form of a work.
<br />
<br /><br />
  A "Standard Interface" means an interface that either is an official
<br />
standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of
<br />
interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that
<br />
is widely used among developers working in that language.
<br />
<br /><br />
  The "System Libraries" of an executable work include anything, other
<br />
than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of
<br />
packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major
<br />
Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that
<br />
Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an
<br />
implementation is available to the public in source code form.  A
<br />
"Major Component", in this context, means a major essential component
<br />
(kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system
<br />
(if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to
<br />
produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.
<br />
<br /><br />
  The "Corresponding Source" for a work in object code form means all
<br />
the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable
<br />
work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to
<br />
control those activities.  However, it does not include the work's
<br />
System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free
<br />
programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but
<br />
which are not part of the work.  For example, Corresponding Source
<br />
includes interface definition files associated with source files for
<br />
the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically
<br />
linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,
<br />
such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those
<br />
subprograms and other parts of the work.
<br />
<br /><br />
  The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users
<br />
can regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding
<br />
Source.
<br />
<br /><br />
  The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that
<br />
same work.
<br />
<br /><br />
  2. Basic Permissions.
<br />
<br /><br />
  All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of
<br />
copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated
<br />
conditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited
<br />
permission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running a
<br />
covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its
<br />
content, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges your
<br />
rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.
<br />
<br /><br />
  You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not
<br />
convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains
<br />
in force.  You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose
<br />
of having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you
<br />
with facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with
<br />
the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do
<br />
not control copyright.  Those thus making or running the covered works
<br />
for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction
<br />
and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of
<br />
your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.
<br />
<br /><br />
  Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under
<br />
the conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10
<br />
makes it unnecessary.
<br />
<br /><br />
  3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.
<br />
<br /><br />
  No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological
<br />
measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article
<br />
11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or
<br />
similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such
<br />
measures.
<br />
<br /><br />
  When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid
<br />
circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention
<br />
is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to
<br />
the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or
<br />
modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's
<br />
users, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of
<br />
technological measures.
<br />
<br /><br />
  4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.
<br />
<br /><br />
  You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you
<br />
receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and
<br />
appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;
<br />
keep intact all notices stating that this License and any
<br />
non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;
<br />
keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all
<br />
recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.
<br />
<br /><br />
  You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,
<br />
and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.
<br />
<br /><br />
  5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.
<br />
<br /><br />
  You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to
<br />
produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the
<br />
terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:
<br />
<br /><br />
    a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified
<br />
    it, and giving a relevant date.
<br />
<br /><br />
    b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is
<br />
    released under this License and any conditions added under section
<br />
    7.  This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to
<br />
    "keep intact all notices".
<br />
<br /><br />
    c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this
<br />
    License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This
<br />
    License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7
<br />
    additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,
<br />
    regardless of how they are packaged.  This License gives no
<br />
    permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not
<br />
    invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.
<br />
<br /><br />
    d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display
<br />
    Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive
<br />
    interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your
<br />
    work need not make them do so.
<br />
<br /><br />
  A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent
<br />
works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,
<br />
and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,
<br />
in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an
<br />
"aggregate" if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not
<br />
used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users
<br />
beyond what the individual works permit.  Inclusion of a covered work
<br />
in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other
<br />
parts of the aggregate.
<br />
<br /><br />
  6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.
<br />
<br /><br />
  You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms
<br />
of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the
<br />
machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,
<br />
in one of these ways:
<br />
<br /><br />
    a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
<br />
    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the
<br />
    Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium
<br />
    customarily used for software interchange.
<br />
<br /><br />
    b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
<br />
    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a
<br />
    written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as
<br />
    long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product
<br />
    model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a
<br />
    copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the
<br />
    product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical
<br />
    medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no
<br />
    more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this
<br />
    conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the
<br />
    Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.
<br />
<br /><br />
    c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the
<br />
    written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This
<br />
    alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and
<br />
    only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord
<br />
    with subsection 6b.
<br />
<br /><br />
    d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated
<br />
    place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the
<br />
    Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no
<br />
    further charge.  You need not require recipients to copy the
<br />
    Corresponding Source along with the object code.  If the place to
<br />
    copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source
<br />
    may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)
<br />
    that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain
<br />
    clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the
<br />
    Corresponding Source.  Regardless of what server hosts the
<br />
    Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is
<br />
    available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.
<br />
<br /><br />
    e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided
<br />
    you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding
<br />
    Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no
<br />
    charge under subsection 6d.
<br />
<br /><br />
  A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded
<br />
from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be
<br />
included in conveying the object code work.
<br />
<br /><br />
  A "User Product" is either (1) a "consumer product", which means any
<br />
tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,
<br />
or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation
<br />
into a dwelling.  In determining whether a product is a consumer product,
<br />
doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.  For a particular
<br />
product received by a particular user, "normally used" refers to a
<br />
typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status
<br />
of the particular user or of the way in which the particular user
<br />
actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product.  A product
<br />
is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial
<br />
commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent
<br />
the only significant mode of use of the product.
<br />
<br /><br />
  "Installation Information" for a User Product means any methods,
<br />
procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install
<br />
and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from
<br />
a modified version of its Corresponding Source.  The information must
<br />
suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object
<br />
code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because
<br />
modification has been made.
<br />
<br /><br />
  If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or
<br />
specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as
<br />
part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the
<br />
User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a
<br />
fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the
<br />
Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied
<br />
by the Installation Information.  But this requirement does not apply
<br />
if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install
<br />
modified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has
<br />
been installed in ROM).
<br />
<br /><br />
  The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a
<br />
requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates
<br />
for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for
<br />
the User Product in which it has been modified or installed.  Access to a
<br />
network may be denied when the modification itself materially and
<br />
adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and
<br />
protocols for communication across the network.
<br />
<br /><br />
  Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,
<br />
in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly
<br />
documented (and with an implementation available to the public in
<br />
source code form), and must require no special password or key for
<br />
unpacking, reading or copying.
<br />
<br /><br />
  7. Additional Terms.
<br />
<br /><br />
  "Additional permissions" are terms that supplement the terms of this
<br />
License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.
<br />
Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall
<br />
be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent
<br />
that they are valid under applicable law.  If additional permissions
<br />
apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately
<br />
under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by
<br />
this License without regard to the additional permissions.
<br />
<br /><br />
  When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option
<br />
remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of
<br />
it.  (Additional permissions may be written to require their own
<br />
removal in certain cases when you modify the work.)  You may place
<br />
additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,
<br />
for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.
<br />
<br /><br />
  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you
<br />
add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of
<br />
that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:
<br />
<br /><br />
    a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the
<br />
    terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or
<br />
<br /><br />
    b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or
<br />
    author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal
<br />
    Notices displayed by works containing it; or
<br />
<br /><br />
    c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or
<br />
    requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in
<br />
    reasonable ways as different from the original version; or
<br />
<br /><br />
    d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or
<br />
    authors of the material; or
<br />
<br /><br />
    e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some
<br />
    trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or
<br />
<br /><br />
    f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that
<br />
    material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of
<br />
    it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for
<br />
    any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on
<br />
    those licensors and authors.
<br />
<br /><br />
  All other non-permissive additional terms are considered "further
<br />
restrictions" within the meaning of section 10.  If the Program as you
<br />
received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is
<br />
governed by this License along with a term that is a further
<br />
restriction, you may remove that term.  If a license document contains
<br />
a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this
<br />
License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms
<br />
of that license document, provided that the further restriction does
<br />
not survive such relicensing or conveying.
<br />
<br /><br />
  If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you
<br />
must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the
<br />
additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating
<br />
where to find the applicable terms.
<br />
<br /><br />
  Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the
<br />
form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;
<br />
the above requirements apply either way.
<br />
<br /><br />
  8. Termination.
<br />
<br /><br />
  You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly
<br />
provided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or
<br />
modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under
<br />
this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third
<br />
paragraph of section 11).
<br />
<br /><br />
  However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your
<br />
license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)
<br />
provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and
<br />
finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright
<br />
holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means
<br />
prior to 60 days after the cessation.
<br />
<br /><br />
  Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is
<br />
reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the
<br />
violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have
<br />
received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that
<br />
copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after
<br />
your receipt of the notice.
<br />
<br /><br />
  Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the
<br />
licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under
<br />
this License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently
<br />
reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same
<br />
material under section 10.
<br />
<br /><br />
  9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.
<br />
<br /><br />
  You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or
<br />
run a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work
<br />
occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission
<br />
to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.  However,
<br />
nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or
<br />
modify any covered work.  These actions infringe copyright if you do
<br />
not accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or propagating a
<br />
covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.
<br />
<br /><br />
  10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.
<br />
<br /><br />
  Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically
<br />
receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and
<br />
propagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not responsible
<br />
for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.
<br />
<br /><br />
  An "entity transaction" is a transaction transferring control of an
<br />
organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an
<br />
organization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a covered
<br />
work results from an entity transaction, each party to that
<br />
transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever
<br />
licenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could
<br />
give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the
<br />
Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if
<br />
the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.
<br />
<br /><br />
  You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the
<br />
rights granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you may
<br />
not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of
<br />
rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation
<br />
(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that
<br />
any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for
<br />
sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.
<br />
<br /><br />
  11. Patents.
<br />
<br /><br />
  A "contributor" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this
<br />
License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.  The
<br />
work thus licensed is called the contributor's "contributor version".
<br />
<br /><br />
  A contributor's "essential patent claims" are all patent claims
<br />
owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or
<br />
hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted
<br />
by this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,
<br />
but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a
<br />
consequence of further modification of the contributor version.  For
<br />
purposes of this definition, "control" includes the right to grant
<br />
patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of
<br />
this License.
<br />
<br /><br />
  Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free
<br />
patent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to
<br />
make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and
<br />
propagate the contents of its contributor version.
<br />
<br /><br />
  In the following three paragraphs, a "patent license" is any express
<br />
agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent
<br />
(such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to
<br />
sue for patent infringement).  To "grant" such a patent license to a
<br />
party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a
<br />
patent against the party.
<br />
<br /><br />
  If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,
<br />
and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone
<br />
to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a
<br />
publicly available network server or other readily accessible means,
<br />
then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so
<br />
available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the
<br />
patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner
<br />
consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent
<br />
license to downstream recipients.  "Knowingly relying" means you have
<br />
actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the
<br />
covered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work
<br />
in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that
<br />
country that you have reason to believe are valid.
<br />
<br /><br />
  If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or
<br />
arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a
<br />
covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties
<br />
receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify
<br />
or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license
<br />
you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered
<br />
work and works based on it.
<br />
<br /><br />
  A patent license is "discriminatory" if it does not include within
<br />
the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is
<br />
conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are
<br />
specifically granted under this License.  You may not convey a covered
<br />
work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is
<br />
in the business of distributing software, under which you make payment
<br />
to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying
<br />
the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the
<br />
parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory
<br />
patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work
<br />
conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily
<br />
for and in connection with specific products or compilations that
<br />
contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,
<br />
or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.
<br />
<br /><br />
  Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting
<br />
any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may
<br />
otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.
<br />
<br /><br />
  12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.
<br />
<br /><br />
  If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
<br />
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
<br />
excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot convey a
<br />
covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
<br />
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may
<br />
not convey it at all.  For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you
<br />
to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey
<br />
the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this
<br />
License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.
<br />
<br /><br />
  13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.
<br />
<br /><br />
  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have
<br />
permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed
<br />
under version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single
<br />
combined work, and to convey the resulting work.  The terms of this
<br />
License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,
<br />
but the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License,
<br />
section 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the
<br />
combination as such.
<br />
<br /><br />
  14. Revised Versions of this License.
<br />
<br /><br />
  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of
<br />
the GNU General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will
<br />
be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
<br />
address new problems or concerns.
<br />
<br /><br />
  Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the
<br />
Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General
<br />
Public License "or any later version" applies to it, you have the
<br />
option of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered
<br />
version or of any later version published by the Free Software
<br />
Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of the
<br />
GNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published
<br />
by the Free Software Foundation.
<br />
<br /><br />
  If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future
<br />
versions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy's
<br />
public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you
<br />
to choose that version for the Program.
<br />
<br /><br />
  Later license versions may give you additional or different
<br />
permissions.  However, no additional obligations are imposed on any
<br />
author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a
<br />
later version.
<br />
<br /><br />
  15. Disclaimer of Warranty.
<br />
<br /><br />
  THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY
<br />
APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT
<br />
HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY
<br />
OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,
<br />
THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
<br />
PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM
<br />
IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF
<br />
ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
<br />
<br /><br />
  16. Limitation of Liability.
<br />
<br /><br />
  IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
<br />
WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS
<br />
THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY
<br />
GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE
<br />
USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF
<br />
DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD
<br />
PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS),
<br />
EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF
<br />
SUCH DAMAGES.
<br />
<br /><br />
  17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.
<br />
<br /><br />
  If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided
<br />
above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,
<br />
reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates
<br />
an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the
<br />
Program, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a
<br />
copy of the Program in return for a fee.
<br />
<br /><br />
                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
<br />
<br /><br />
            How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs
<br />
<br /><br />
  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
<br />
possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
<br />
free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.
<br />
<br /><br />
  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest
<br />
to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
<br />
state the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
<br />
the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.
<br />
<br /><br />
    <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>
<br />
    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>
<br />
<br /><br />
    This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify
<br />
    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
<br />
    the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or
<br />
    (at your option) any later version.
<br />
<br /><br />
    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
<br />
    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
<br />
    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the
<br />
    GNU General Public License for more details.
<br />
<br /><br />
    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
<br />
    along with this program.  If not, see <http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.
<br />
<br /><br />
Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.
<br />
<br /><br />
  If the program does terminal interaction, make it output a short
<br />
notice like this when it starts in an interactive mode:
<br />
<br /><br />
    <program>  Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>
<br />
    This program comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.
<br />
    This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it
<br />
    under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.
<br />
<br /><br />
The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate
<br />
parts of the General Public License.  Of course, your program's commands
<br />
might be different; for a GUI interface, you would use an "about box".
<br />
<br /><br />
  You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school,
<br />
if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if necessary.
<br />
For more information on this, and how to apply and follow the GNU GPL, see
<br />
<http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.
<br />
<br /><br />
  The GNU General Public License does not permit incorporating your program
<br />
into proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you
<br />
may consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with
<br />
the library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General
<br />
Public License instead of this License.  But first, please read

GCC RUNTIME LIBRARY EXCEPTION
<br />
<br /><br />
Version 3.1, 31 March 2009
<br />
<br /><br />
Copyright (C) 2009 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <http://fsf.org/>
<br />
<br /><br />
Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this
<br />
license document, but changing it is not allowed.
<br />
<br /><br />
This GCC Runtime Library Exception ("Exception") is an additional
<br />
permission under section 7 of the GNU General Public License, version
<br />
3 ("GPLv3"). It applies to a given file (the "Runtime Library") that
<br />
bears a notice placed by the copyright holder of the file stating that
<br />
the file is governed by GPLv3 along with this Exception.
<br />
<br /><br />
When you use GCC to compile a program, GCC may combine portions of
<br />
certain GCC header files and runtime libraries with the compiled
<br />
program. The purpose of this Exception is to allow compilation of
<br />
non-GPL (including proprietary) programs to use, in this way, the
<br />
header files and runtime libraries covered by this Exception.
<br />
<br /><br />
0. Definitions.
<br />
<br /><br />
A file is an "Independent Module" if it either requires the Runtime
<br />
Library for execution after a Compilation Process, or makes use of an
<br />
interface provided by the Runtime Library, but is not otherwise based
<br />
on the Runtime Library.
<br />
<br /><br />
"GCC" means a version of the GNU Compiler Collection, with or without
<br />
modifications, governed by version 3 (or a specified later version) of
<br />
the GNU General Public License (GPL) with the option of using any
<br />
subsequent versions published by the FSF.
<br />
<br /><br />
"GPL-compatible Software" is software whose conditions of propagation,
<br />
modification and use would permit combination with GCC in accord with
<br />
the license of GCC.
<br />
<br /><br />
"Target Code" refers to output from any compiler for a real or virtual
<br />
target processor architecture, in executable form or suitable for
<br />
input to an assembler, loader, linker and/or execution
<br />
phase. Notwithstanding that, Target Code does not include data in any
<br />
format that is used as a compiler intermediate representation, or used
<br />
for producing a compiler intermediate representation.
<br />
<br /><br />
The "Compilation Process" transforms code entirely represented in
<br />
non-intermediate languages designed for human-written code, and/or in
<br />
Java Virtual Machine byte code, into Target Code. Thus, for example,
<br />
use of source code generators and preprocessors need not be considered
<br />
part of the Compilation Process, since the Compilation Process can be
<br />
understood as starting with the output of the generators or
<br />
preprocessors.
<br />
<br /><br />
A Compilation Process is "Eligible" if it is done using GCC, alone or
<br />
with other GPL-compatible software, or if it is done without using any
<br />
work based on GCC. For example, using non-GPL-compatible Software to
<br />
optimize any GCC intermediate representations would not qualify as an
<br />
Eligible Compilation Process.
<br />
<br /><br />
1. Grant of Additional Permission.
<br />
<br /><br />
You have permission to propagate a work of Target Code formed by
<br />
combining the Runtime Library with Independent Modules, even if such
<br />
propagation would otherwise violate the terms of GPLv3, provided that
<br />
all Target Code was generated by Eligible Compilation Processes. You
<br />
may then convey such a combination under terms of your choice,
<br />
consistent with the licensing of the Independent Modules.
<br />
<br /><br />
2. No Weakening of GCC Copyleft.
<br />
<br /><br />
The availability of this Exception does not imply any general
<br />
presumption that third-party software is unaffected by the copyleft
<br />
requirements of the license of GCC.

                    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
<br />
                       Version 3, 29 June 2007
<br />
<br /><br />
 Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <http://fsf.org/>
<br />
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
<br />
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
<br />
<br /><br />
                            Preamble
<br />
<br /><br />
  The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for
<br />
software and other kinds of works.
<br />
<br /><br />
  The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed
<br />
to take away your freedom to share and change the works.  By contrast,
<br />
the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to
<br />
share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free
<br />
software for all its users.  We, the Free Software Foundation, use the
<br />
GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to
<br />
any other work released this way by its authors.  You can apply it to
<br />
your programs, too.
<br />
<br /><br />
  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
<br />
price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
<br />
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
<br />
them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you
<br />
want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new
<br />
free programs, and that you know you can do these things.
<br />
<br /><br />
  To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you
<br />
these rights or asking you to surrender the rights.  Therefore, you have
<br />
certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if
<br />
you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.
<br />
<br /><br />
  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
<br />
gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same
<br />
freedoms that you received.  You must make sure that they, too, receive
<br />
or can get the source code.  And you must show them these terms so they
<br />
know their rights.
<br />
<br /><br />
  Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:
<br />
(1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License
<br />
giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.
<br />
<br /><br />
  For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains
<br />
that there is no warranty for this free software.  For both users' and
<br />
authors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as
<br />
changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to
<br />
authors of previous versions.
<br />
<br /><br />
  Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run
<br />
modified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer
<br />
can do so.  This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of
<br />
protecting users' freedom to change the software.  The systematic
<br />
pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to
<br />
use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable.  Therefore, we
<br />
have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those
<br />
products.  If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we
<br />
stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions
<br />
of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.
<br />
<br /><br />
  Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.
<br />
States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of
<br />
software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to
<br />
avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could
<br />
make it effectively proprietary.  To prevent this, the GPL assures that
<br />
patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.
<br />
<br /><br />
  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
<br />
modification follow.
<br />
<br /><br />
                       TERMS AND CONDITIONS
<br />
<br /><br />
  0. Definitions.
<br />
<br /><br />
  "This License" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.
<br />
<br /><br />
  "Copyright" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of
<br />
works, such as semiconductor masks.
<br />
<br /><br />
  "The Program" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this
<br />
License.  Each licensee is addressed as "you".  "Licensees" and
<br />
"recipients" may be individuals or organizations.
<br />
<br /><br />
  To "modify" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work
<br />
in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an
<br />
exact copy.  The resulting work is called a "modified version" of the
<br />
earlier work or a work "based on" the earlier work.
<br />
<br /><br />
  A "covered work" means either the unmodified Program or a work based
<br />
on the Program.
<br />
<br /><br />
  To "propagate" a work means to do anything with it that, without
<br />
permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for
<br />
infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a
<br />
computer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes copying,
<br />
distribution (with or without modification), making available to the
<br />
public, and in some countries other activities as well.
<br />
<br /><br />
  To "convey" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other
<br />
parties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user through
<br />
a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.
<br />
<br /><br />
  An interactive user interface displays "Appropriate Legal Notices"
<br />
to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible
<br />
feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)
<br />
tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the
<br />
extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the
<br />
work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.  If
<br />
the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a
<br />
menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.
<br />
<br /><br />
  1. Source Code.
<br />
<br /><br />
  The "source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work
<br />
for making modifications to it.  "Object code" means any non-source
<br />
form of a work.
<br />
<br /><br />
  A "Standard Interface" means an interface that either is an official
<br />
standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of
<br />
interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that
<br />
is widely used among developers working in that language.
<br />
<br /><br />
  The "System Libraries" of an executable work include anything, other
<br />
than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of
<br />
packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major
<br />
Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that
<br />
Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an
<br />
implementation is available to the public in source code form.  A
<br />
"Major Component", in this context, means a major essential component
<br />
(kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system
<br />
(if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to
<br />
produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.
<br />
<br /><br />
  The "Corresponding Source" for a work in object code form means all
<br />
the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable
<br />
work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to
<br />
control those activities.  However, it does not include the work's
<br />
System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free
<br />
programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but
<br />
which are not part of the work.  For example, Corresponding Source
<br />
includes interface definition files associated with source files for
<br />
the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically
<br />
linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,
<br />
such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those
<br />
subprograms and other parts of the work.
<br />
<br /><br />
  The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users
<br />
can regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding
<br />
Source.
<br />
<br /><br />
  The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that
<br />
same work.
<br />
<br /><br />
  2. Basic Permissions.
<br />
<br /><br />
  All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of
<br />
copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated
<br />
conditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited
<br />
permission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running a
<br />
covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its
<br />
content, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges your
<br />
rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.
<br />
<br /><br />
  You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not
<br />
convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains
<br />
in force.  You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose
<br />
of having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you
<br />
with facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with
<br />
the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do
<br />
not control copyright.  Those thus making or running the covered works
<br />
for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction
<br />
and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of
<br />
your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.
<br />
<br /><br />
  Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under
<br />
the conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10
<br />
makes it unnecessary.
<br />
<br /><br />
  3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.
<br />
<br /><br />
  No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological
<br />
measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article
<br />
11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or
<br />
similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such
<br />
measures.
<br />
<br /><br />
  When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid
<br />
circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention
<br />
is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to
<br />
the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or
<br />
modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's
<br />
users, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of
<br />
technological measures.
<br />
<br /><br />
  4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.
<br />
<br /><br />
  You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you
<br />
receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and
<br />
appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;
<br />
keep intact all notices stating that this License and any
<br />
non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;
<br />
keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all
<br />
recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.
<br />
<br /><br />
  You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,
<br />
and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.
<br />
<br /><br />
  5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.
<br />
<br /><br />
  You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to
<br />
produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the
<br />
terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:
<br />
<br /><br />
    a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified
<br />
    it, and giving a relevant date.
<br />
<br /><br />
    b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is
<br />
    released under this License and any conditions added under section
<br />
    7.  This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to
<br />
    "keep intact all notices".
<br />
<br /><br />
    c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this
<br />
    License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This
<br />
    License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7
<br />
    additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,
<br />
    regardless of how they are packaged.  This License gives no
<br />
    permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not
<br />
    invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.
<br />
<br /><br />
    d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display
<br />
    Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive
<br />
    interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your
<br />
    work need not make them do so.
<br />
<br /><br />
  A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent
<br />
works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,
<br />
and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,
<br />
in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an
<br />
"aggregate" if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not
<br />
used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users
<br />
beyond what the individual works permit.  Inclusion of a covered work
<br />
in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other
<br />
parts of the aggregate.
<br />
<br /><br />
  6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.
<br />
<br /><br />
  You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms
<br />
of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the
<br />
machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,
<br />
in one of these ways:
<br />
<br /><br />
    a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
<br />
    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the
<br />
    Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium
<br />
    customarily used for software interchange.
<br />
<br /><br />
    b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
<br />
    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a
<br />
    written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as
<br />
    long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product
<br />
    model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a
<br />
    copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the
<br />
    product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical
<br />
    medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no
<br />
    more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this
<br />
    conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the
<br />
    Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.
<br />
<br /><br />
    c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the
<br />
    written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This
<br />
    alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and
<br />
    only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord
<br />
    with subsection 6b.
<br />
<br /><br />
    d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated
<br />
    place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the
<br />
    Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no
<br />
    further charge.  You need not require recipients to copy the
<br />
    Corresponding Source along with the object code.  If the place to
<br />
    copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source
<br />
    may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)
<br />
    that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain
<br />
    clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the
<br />
    Corresponding Source.  Regardless of what server hosts the
<br />
    Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is
<br />
    available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.
<br />
<br /><br />
    e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided
<br />
    you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding
<br />
    Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no
<br />
    charge under subsection 6d.
<br />
<br /><br />
  A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded
<br />
from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be
<br />
included in conveying the object code work.
<br />
<br /><br />
  A "User Product" is either (1) a "consumer product", which means any
<br />
tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,
<br />
or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation
<br />
into a dwelling.  In determining whether a product is a consumer product,
<br />
doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.  For a particular
<br />
product received by a particular user, "normally used" refers to a
<br />
typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status
<br />
of the particular user or of the way in which the particular user
<br />
actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product.  A product
<br />
is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial
<br />
commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent
<br />
the only significant mode of use of the product.
<br />
<br /><br />
  "Installation Information" for a User Product means any methods,
<br />
procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install
<br />
and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from
<br />
a modified version of its Corresponding Source.  The information must
<br />
suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object
<br />
code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because
<br />
modification has been made.
<br />
<br /><br />
  If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or
<br />
specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as
<br />
part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the
<br />
User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a
<br />
fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the
<br />
Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied
<br />
by the Installation Information.  But this requirement does not apply
<br />
if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install
<br />
modified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has
<br />
been installed in ROM).
<br />
<br /><br />
  The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a
<br />
requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates
<br />
for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for
<br />
the User Product in which it has been modified or installed.  Access to a
<br />
network may be denied when the modification itself materially and
<br />
adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and
<br />
protocols for communication across the network.
<br />
<br /><br />
  Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,
<br />
in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly
<br />
documented (and with an implementation available to the public in
<br />
source code form), and must require no special password or key for
<br />
unpacking, reading or copying.
<br />
<br /><br />
  7. Additional Terms.
<br />
<br /><br />
  "Additional permissions" are terms that supplement the terms of this
<br />
License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.
<br />
Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall
<br />
be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent
<br />
that they are valid under applicable law.  If additional permissions
<br />
apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately
<br />
under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by
<br />
this License without regard to the additional permissions.
<br />
<br /><br />
  When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option
<br />
remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of
<br />
it.  (Additional permissions may be written to require their own
<br />
removal in certain cases when you modify the work.)  You may place
<br />
additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,
<br />
for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.
<br />
<br /><br />
  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you
<br />
add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of
<br />
that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:
<br />
<br /><br />
    a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the
<br />
    terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or
<br />
<br /><br />
    b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or
<br />
    author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal
<br />
    Notices displayed by works containing it; or
<br />
<br /><br />
    c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or
<br />
    requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in
<br />
    reasonable ways as different from the original version; or
<br />
<br /><br />
    d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or
<br />
    authors of the material; or
<br />
<br /><br />
    e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some
<br />
    trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or
<br />
<br /><br />
    f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that
<br />
    material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of
<br />
    it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for
<br />
    any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on
<br />
    those licensors and authors.
<br />
<br /><br />
  All other non-permissive additional terms are considered "further
<br />
restrictions" within the meaning of section 10.  If the Program as you
<br />
received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is
<br />
governed by this License along with a term that is a further
<br />
restriction, you may remove that term.  If a license document contains
<br />
a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this
<br />
License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms
<br />
of that license document, provided that the further restriction does
<br />
not survive such relicensing or conveying.
<br />
<br /><br />
  If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you
<br />
must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the
<br />
additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating
<br />
where to find the applicable terms.
<br />
<br /><br />
  Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the
<br />
form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;
<br />
the above requirements apply either way.
<br />
<br /><br />
  8. Termination.
<br />
<br /><br />
  You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly
<br />
provided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or
<br />
modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under
<br />
this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third
<br />
paragraph of section 11).
<br />
<br /><br />
  However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your
<br />
license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)
<br />
provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and
<br />
finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright
<br />
holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means
<br />
prior to 60 days after the cessation.
<br />
<br /><br />
  Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is
<br />
reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the
<br />
violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have
<br />
received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that
<br />
copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after
<br />
your receipt of the notice.
<br />
<br /><br />
  Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the
<br />
licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under
<br />
this License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently
<br />
reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same
<br />
material under section 10.
<br />
<br /><br />
  9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.
<br />
<br /><br />
  You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or
<br />
run a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work
<br />
occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission
<br />
to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.  However,
<br />
nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or
<br />
modify any covered work.  These actions infringe copyright if you do
<br />
not accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or propagating a
<br />
covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.
<br />
<br /><br />
  10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.
<br />
<br /><br />
  Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically
<br />
receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and
<br />
propagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not responsible
<br />
for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.
<br />
<br /><br />
  An "entity transaction" is a transaction transferring control of an
<br />
organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an
<br />
organization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a covered
<br />
work results from an entity transaction, each party to that
<br />
transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever
<br />
licenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could
<br />
give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the
<br />
Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if
<br />
the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.
<br />
<br /><br />
  You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the
<br />
rights granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you may
<br />
not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of
<br />
rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation
<br />
(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that
<br />
any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for
<br />
sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.
<br />
<br /><br />
  11. Patents.
<br />
<br /><br />
  A "contributor" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this
<br />
License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.  The
<br />
work thus licensed is called the contributor's "contributor version".
<br />
<br /><br />
  A contributor's "essential patent claims" are all patent claims
<br />
owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or
<br />
hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted
<br />
by this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,
<br />
but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a
<br />
consequence of further modification of the contributor version.  For
<br />
purposes of this definition, "control" includes the right to grant
<br />
patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of
<br />
this License.
<br />
<br /><br />
  Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free
<br />
patent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to
<br />
make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and
<br />
propagate the contents of its contributor version.
<br />
<br /><br />
  In the following three paragraphs, a "patent license" is any express
<br />
agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent
<br />
(such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to
<br />
sue for patent infringement).  To "grant" such a patent license to a
<br />
party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a
<br />
patent against the party.
<br />
<br /><br />
  If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,
<br />
and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone
<br />
to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a
<br />
publicly available network server or other readily accessible means,
<br />
then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so
<br />
available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the
<br />
patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner
<br />
consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent
<br />
license to downstream recipients.  "Knowingly relying" means you have
<br />
actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the
<br />
covered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work
<br />
in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that
<br />
country that you have reason to believe are valid.
<br />
<br /><br />
  If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or
<br />
arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a
<br />
covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties
<br />
receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify
<br />
or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license
<br />
you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered
<br />
work and works based on it.
<br />
<br /><br />
  A patent license is "discriminatory" if it does not include within
<br />
the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is
<br />
conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are
<br />
specifically granted under this License.  You may not convey a covered
<br />
work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is
<br />
in the business of distributing software, under which you make payment
<br />
to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying
<br />
the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the
<br />
parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory
<br />
patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work
<br />
conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily
<br />
for and in connection with specific products or compilations that
<br />
contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,
<br />
or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.
<br />
<br /><br />
  Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting
<br />
any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may
<br />
otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.
<br />
<br /><br />
  12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.
<br />
<br /><br />
  If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
<br />
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
<br />
excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot convey a
<br />
covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
<br />
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may
<br />
not convey it at all.  For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you
<br />
to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey
<br />
the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this
<br />
License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.
<br />
<br /><br />
  13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.
<br />
<br /><br />
  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have
<br />
permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed
<br />
under version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single
<br />
combined work, and to convey the resulting work.  The terms of this
<br />
License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,
<br />
but the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License,
<br />
section 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the
<br />
combination as such.
<br />
<br /><br />
  14. Revised Versions of this License.
<br />
<br /><br />
  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of
<br />
the GNU General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will
<br />
be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
<br />
address new problems or concerns.
<br />
<br /><br />
  Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the
<br />
Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General
<br />
Public License "or any later version" applies to it, you have the
<br />
option of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered
<br />
version or of any later version published by the Free Software
<br />
Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of the
<br />
GNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published
<br />
by the Free Software Foundation.
<br />
<br /><br />
  If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future
<br />
versions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy's
<br />
public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you
<br />
to choose that version for the Program.
<br />
<br /><br />
  Later license versions may give you additional or different
<br />
permissions.  However, no additional obligations are imposed on any
<br />
author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a
<br />
later version.
<br />
<br /><br />
  15. Disclaimer of Warranty.
<br />
<br /><br />
  THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY
<br />
APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT
<br />
HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY
<br />
OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,
<br />
THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
<br />
PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM
<br />
IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF
<br />
ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
<br />
<br /><br />
  16. Limitation of Liability.
<br />
<br /><br />
  IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
<br />
WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS
<br />
THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY
<br />
GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE
<br />
USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF
<br />
DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD
<br />
PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS),
<br />
EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF
<br />
SUCH DAMAGES.
<br />
<br /><br />
  17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.
<br />
<br /><br />
  If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided
<br />
above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,
<br />
reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates
<br />
an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the
<br />
Program, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a
<br />
copy of the Program in return for a fee.
<br />
<br /><br />
                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
<br />
<br /><br />
            How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs
<br />
<br /><br />
  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
<br />
possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
<br />
free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.
<br />
<br /><br />
  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest
<br />
to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
<br />
state the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
<br />
the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.
<br />
<br /><br />
    <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>
<br />
    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>
<br />
<br /><br />
    This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify
<br />
    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
<br />
    the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or
<br />
    (at your option) any later version.
<br />
<br /><br />
    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
<br />
    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
<br />
    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the
<br />
    GNU General Public License for more details.
<br />
<br /><br />
    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
<br />
    along with this program.  If not, see <http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.
<br />
<br /><br />
Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.
<br />
<br /><br />
  If the program does terminal interaction, make it output a short
<br />
notice like this when it starts in an interactive mode:
<br />
<br /><br />
    <program>  Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>
<br />
    This program comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.
<br />
    This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it
<br />
    under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.
<br />
<br /><br />
The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate
<br />
parts of the General Public License.  Of course, your program's commands
<br />
might be different; for a GUI interface, you would use an "about box".
<br />
<br /><br />
  You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school,
<br />
if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if necessary.
<br />
For more information on this, and how to apply and follow the GNU GPL, see
<br />
<http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.
<br />
<br /><br />
  The GNU General Public License does not permit incorporating your program
<br />
into proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you
<br />
may consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with
<br />
the library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General
<br />
Public License instead of this License.  But first, please read
<br />
<http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/why-not-lgpl.html>.

 TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION
<br />
 .
<br />
 1. Definitions.
<br />
 .
<br />
    "License" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,
<br />
    and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.
<br />
 .
<br />
    "Licensor" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by
<br />
    the copyright owner that is granting the License.
<br />

<br />
    "Legal Entity" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all
<br />
    other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
<br />
    control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,
<br />
    "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
<br />
    direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
<br />
    otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
<br />
    outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.
<br />
 .
<br />
    "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
<br />
    exercising permissions granted by this License.
<br />
 .
<br />

<br />
    source, and configuration files.
<br />
 .
<br />
    "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
<br />
    transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
<br />
    not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
<br />
    and conversions to other media types.
<br />
 .
<br />
    "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
<br />
    Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
<br />
    copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
<br />
    (an example is provided in the Appendix below).
<br />
 .
<br />
    "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
<br />
    form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
<br />
    editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
<br />
    represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
<br />
    of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
<br />
    separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
<br />
    the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
<br />
 .
<br />
    "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
<br />
    the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
<br />
    to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
<br />
    submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
<br />
    or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
<br />
    the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
<br />
    means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
<br />
    to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
<br />
    communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
<br />
    and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
<br />
    Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
<br />
    excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
<br />
    designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."
<br />
 .
<br />
    "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
<br />
    on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
<br />
    subsequently incorporated within the Work.
<br />
 .
<br />
 2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
<br />
    this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
<br />
    worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
<br />
    copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
<br />
    publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
<br />
    Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
<br />
 .
<br />
 3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
<br />
    this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
<br />
    worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
<br />
    (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
<br />
    use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
<br />
    where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
<br />
    by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
<br />
    Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
<br />
    with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
<br />
    institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
<br />
    cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
<br />
    or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
<br />
    or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
<br />
    granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
<br />
    as of the date such litigation is filed.
<br />
 .
<br />
 4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
<br />
    Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
<br />
    modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
<br />
    meet the following conditions:
<br />
 .
<br />
    (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
<br />
        Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
<br />
 .
<br />
    (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
<br />
        stating that You changed the files; and
<br />
 .
<br />
    (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
<br />
        that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
<br />
        attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
<br />
        excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
<br />
        the Derivative Works; and
<br />
 .
<br />
    (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
<br />
        distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
<br />
        include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
<br />
        within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
<br />
        pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
<br />
        of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
<br />
        as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
<br />
        documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
<br />
        within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
<br />
        wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
<br />
        of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
<br />
        do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
<br />
        notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
<br />
        or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
<br />
        that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
<br />
        as modifying the License.
<br />
 .
<br />
    You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
<br />
    may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
<br />
    for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
<br />
    for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
<br />
    reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
<br />
    the conditions stated in this License.
<br />
 .
<br />
 5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
<br />
    any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
<br />
    by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
<br />
    this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
<br />
    Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
<br />
    the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
<br />
    with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
<br />
 .
<br />
 6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
<br />
    names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
<br />
    except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
<br />
    origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
<br />
 .
<br />
 7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
<br />
    agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
<br />
    Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
<br />
    WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
<br />
    implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
<br />
    of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
<br />
    PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
<br />
    appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
<br />
    risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
<br />
 .
<br />
 8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
<br />
    whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
<br />
    unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
<br />
    negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
<br />
    liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
<br />
    incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
<br />
    result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
<br />
    Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
<br />
    work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
<br />
    other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
<br />
    has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
<br />
 .
<br />
 9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
<br />
    the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
<br />
    and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
<br />
    or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
<br />
    License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
<br />
    on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
<br />
    of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
<br />
    defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
<br />
    incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
<br />
    of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
<br />
 .
<br />
 END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
<br />
 .
<br />
 APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.
<br />
 .
<br />
    To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following
<br />
    boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets "[]"
<br />
    replaced with your own identifying information. (Don't include

<br />
    comment syntax for the file format. We also recommend that a
<br />
    file or class name and description of purpose be included on the
<br />
    same "printed page" as the copyright notice for easier
<br />
    identification within third-party archives.

<br />
 or incorporates Python or any part thereof, and wants to make
<br />
 the derivative work available to others as provided herein, then
<br />
 Licensee hereby agrees to include in any such work a brief summary of
<br />
 the changes made to Python.
<br />

 .
<br />
 6. This License Agreement will automatically terminate upon a material
<br />
 breach of its terms and conditions.
<br />
 .
<br />
 7. Nothing in this License Agreement shall be deemed to create any

A. HISTORY OF THE SOFTWARE
<br />
==========================
<br />
<br /><br />
Python was created in the early 1990s by Guido van Rossum at Stichting
<br />
Mathematisch Centrum (CWI, see http://www.cwi.nl) in the Netherlands
<br />
as a successor of a language called ABC.  Guido remains Python's
<br />
principal author, although it includes many contributions from others.
<br />
<br /><br />
In 1995, Guido continued his work on Python at the Corporation for
<br />
National Research Initiatives (CNRI, see http://www.cnri.reston.va.us)
<br />
in Reston, Virginia where he released several versions of the
<br />
software.
<br />
<br /><br />
In May 2000, Guido and the Python core development team moved to
<br />
BeOpen.com to form the BeOpen PythonLabs team.  In October of the same
<br />
year, the PythonLabs team moved to Digital Creations (now Zope
<br />
Corporation, see http://www.zope.com).  In 2001, the Python Software
<br />
Foundation (PSF, see http://www.python.org/psf/) was formed, a
<br />
non-profit organization created specifically to own Python-related
<br />
Intellectual Property.  Zope Corporation is a sponsoring member of
<br />
the PSF.
<br />
<br /><br />
All Python releases are Open Source (see http://www.opensource.org for
<br />
the Open Source Definition).  Historically, most, but not all, Python
<br />
releases have also been GPL-compatible; the table below summarizes
<br />
the various releases.
<br />
<br /><br />
    Release         Derived     Year        Owner       GPL-
<br />
                    from                                compatible? (1)
<br />
<br /><br />
    0.9.0 thru 1.2              1991-1995   CWI         yes
<br />
    1.3 thru 1.5.2  1.2         1995-1999   CNRI        yes
<br />
    1.6             1.5.2       2000        CNRI        no
<br />
    2.0             1.6         2000        BeOpen.com  no
<br />
    1.6.1           1.6         2001        CNRI        yes (2)
<br />
    2.1             2.0+1.6.1   2001        PSF         no
<br />
    2.0.1           2.0+1.6.1   2001        PSF         yes
<br />
    2.1.1           2.1+2.0.1   2001        PSF         yes
<br />
    2.1.2           2.1.1       2002        PSF         yes
<br />
    2.1.3           2.1.2       2002        PSF         yes
<br />
    2.2 and above   2.1.1       2001-now    PSF         yes
<br />
<br /><br />
Footnotes:
<br />
<br /><br />
(1) GPL-compatible doesn't mean that we're distributing Python under
<br />
    the GPL.  All Python licenses, unlike the GPL, let you distribute
<br />
    a modified version without making your changes open source.  The
<br />
    GPL-compatible licenses make it possible to combine Python with
<br />
    other software that is released under the GPL; the others don't.
<br />
<br /><br />
(2) According to Richard Stallman, 1.6.1 is not GPL-compatible,
<br />
    because its license has a choice of law clause.  According to
<br />
    CNRI, however, Stallman's lawyer has told CNRI's lawyer that 1.6.1
<br />
    is "not incompatible" with the GPL.
<br />
<br /><br />
Thanks to the many outside volunteers who have worked under Guido's
<br />
direction to make these releases possible.

A. HISTORY OF THE SOFTWARE
<br />
==========================
<br />
<br /><br />
Python was created in the early 1990s by Guido van Rossum at Stichting
<br />
Mathematisch Centrum (CWI, see http://www.cwi.nl) in the Netherlands
<br />
as a successor of a language called ABC.  Guido remains Python's
<br />
principal author, although it includes many contributions from others.
<br />
<br /><br />
In 1995, Guido continued his work on Python at the Corporation for
<br />
National Research Initiatives (CNRI, see http://www.cnri.reston.va.us)
<br />
in Reston, Virginia where he released several versions of the
<br />
software.
<br />
<br /><br />
In May 2000, Guido and the Python core development team moved to
<br />
BeOpen.com to form the BeOpen PythonLabs team.  In October of the same
<br />
year, the PythonLabs team moved to Digital Creations, which became
<br />
Zope Corporation.  In 2001, the Python Software Foundation (PSF, see
<br />
https://www.python.org/psf/) was formed, a non-profit organization
<br />
created specifically to own Python-related Intellectual Property.
<br />
Zope Corporation was a sponsoring member of the PSF.

All Python releases are Open Source (see http://www.opensource.org for
<br />
the Open Source Definition).  Historically, most, but not all, Python
<br />
releases have also been GPL-compatible; the table below summarizes
<br />
the various releases.

<br />
<br /><br />
Footnotes:
<br />
<br /><br />
(1) GPL-compatible doesn't mean that we're distributing Python under
<br />
    the GPL.  All Python licenses, unlike the GPL, let you distribute
<br />
    a modified version without making your changes open source.  The
<br />
    GPL-compatible licenses make it possible to combine Python with
<br />
    other software that is released under the GPL; the others don't.
<br />
<br /><br />
(2) According to Richard Stallman, 1.6.1 is not GPL-compatible,
<br />
    because its license has a choice of law clause.  According to
<br />
    CNRI, however, Stallman's lawyer has told CNRI's lawyer that 1.6.1
<br />
    is "not incompatible" with the GPL.
<br />
<br /><br />
Thanks to the many outside volunteers who have worked under Guido's
<br />
direction to make these releases possible.

Copyright Release for
<br />
Contributions To SQLite
<br />
<br /><br />
SQLite is software that implements an embeddable SQL database engine. SQLite is available for free download from http://www.sqlite.org/. The principal author and maintainer of SQLite has disclaimed all copyright interest in his contributions to SQLite and thus released his contributions into the public domain. In order to keep the SQLite software unencumbered by copyright claims, the principal author asks others who may from time to time contribute changes and enhancements to likewise disclaim their own individual copyright interest.
<br />
<br /><br />
Because the SQLite software found at http://www.sqlite.org/ is in the public domain, anyone is free to download the SQLite software from that website, make changes to the software, use, distribute, or sell the modified software, under either the original name or under some new name, without any need to obtain permission, pay royalties, acknowledge the original source of the software, or in any other way compensate, identify, or notify the original authors. Nobody is in any way compelled to contribute their SQLite changes and enhancements back to the SQLite website. This document concerns only changes and enhancements to SQLite that are intentionally and deliberately contributed back to the SQLite website.
<br />
<br /><br />
For the purposes of this document, "SQLite software" shall mean any computer source code, documentation, makefiles, test scripts, or other information that is published on the SQLite website, http://www.sqlite.org/. Precompiled binaries are excluded from the definition of "SQLite software" in this document because the process of compiling the software may introduce information from outside sources which is not properly a part of SQLite.
<br />
<br /><br />
The header comments on the SQLite source files exhort the reader to share freely and to never take more than one gives. In the spirit of that exhortation I make the following declarations:
<br />
<br /><br />
I dedicate to the public domain any and all copyright interest in the SQLite software that was publicly available on the SQLite website (http://www.sqlite.org/) prior to the date of the signature below and any changes or enhancements to the SQLite software that I may cause to be published on that website in the future. I make this dedication for the benefit of the public at large and to the detriment of my heirs and successors. I intend this dedication to be an overt act of relinquishment in perpetuity of all present and future rights to the SQLite software under copyright law.
<br />
<br /><br />
To the best of my knowledge and belief, the changes and enhancements that I have contributed to SQLite are either originally written by me or are derived from prior works which I have verified are also in the public domain and are not subject to claims of copyright by other parties.
<br />
<br /><br />
To the best of my knowledge and belief, no individual, business, organization, government, or other entity has any copyright interest in the SQLite software as it existed on the SQLite website as of the date on the signature line below.
<br />
<br /><br />
I agree never to publish any additional information to the SQLite website (by CVS, email, scp, FTP, or any other means) unless that information is an original work of authorship by me or is derived from prior published versions of SQLite. I agree never to copy and paste code into the SQLite code base from other sources. I agree never to publish on the SQLite website any information that would violate a law or breach a contract.<br />
