### *The power of the **Sim4Life** simulation platform, boosted by its revolutionary web interface!*

<br>

**Sim4Life** is the most advanced simulation platform combining computable human phantoms with physics solvers and tissue models, for directly analyzing biological real-world phenomena and complex technical devices in a validated biological and anatomical environment. **Sim4Life.web** is the native implementation of Sim4Life in the cloud that allows users to easily access, run, and share simulations in the cloud from any web browser. The web version offers the same features and performance as the desktop version but is more flexible, maintenance-free, and easier to use. It does not require powerful in-house computational resources as it relies on AWSâ€™s virtually unlimited cloud-computing infrastructure. 

All modeling capabilities from the segmentation of medical image data, anatomical and CAD model import, discretization and simulation to visualization and analysis are embedded and streamlined to offer the most versatile and efficient simulation environment possible.

At the core of **Sim4Life** are the computable, high-fidelity 3D Virtual Population (ViP) human anatomical models. Carefully selected to fully represent global variations in human anatomy, the fully posable, morphable, and validated ViP models along with the IT'IS tissue properties database depict 15 different body types with 120 vital anatomical features and over 300 precisely identified tissues and organs. Cited and applied in hundreds of published studies and papers, the ViP models and the IT'IS material parameter database are continually and meticulously updated, refined, and expanded. 

The full-featured **Sim4Life.web** platform can be accessed in one of two ways:
* [**sim4life.io**](https://sim4life.io/) - Intended for businesses. Functions on a pay-per-use model.
* [**sim4life.science**](https://sim4life.science/) - Intended for academic research groups. Functions on a pay-per-use model, with a significant academic discount.

A full comparison of the different versions of **Sim4Life** can be found on our website at [sim4life.swiss/specifications](https://sim4life.swiss/specifications).
