## Creating a New Project

**Project from Scratch**
  - You may choose to create a project from scratch or based on an existing project. To create an empty project with no services inside, navigate to the *Project* tab of the *Dashboard*, click on the <code> + New </code> button, and select Sim4Life, which will start the user interface of the Sim4Life service.

**Project from Tutorial**
  - You may also create the project from an existing *Tutorials* by navigating to the ```TUTORIALS``` tab of the ```Dashboard``` and clicking on an existing card. This will create a copy of the *Tutorial* project which will from this point on, be accessible from the ```PROJECTS``` tab of the ```Dashboard```. This project will be private unless you decide to share it and any changes you make to the resulting project will not affect the *Tutorial* you have copied from.

**Copying a Project**
  - You may choose to create a project from an existing one by creating a copy of it. To create a copy of a *Project* go to the ```PROJECTS``` tab of the ```Dashboard```, click on the More options (3-dots) button on the *Project* card, and select ```Duplicate```.
