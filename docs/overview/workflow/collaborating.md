## Collaboration


The collaborative workspace feature in the Sim4Life allows multiple users to interact in the project workbench view, each capable of running their own services simultaneously. Here's a detailed description of what is happening:

**Shared Workspace Visualization**
  - On the left side, we see User A's workspace, where multiple projects are displayed in a grid format. These projects include simulations, pipelines, and other files.
  - On the right side, we see User B's workspace, showing only a subset of projects.
  - Both users are working under the "My Workspace" tab but are interacting with shared projects.
    
**Real-time Collaboration**
  - A project labeled "Collaborating" appears in both users' workspaces, signifying a shared project.
  - This feature allows real-time synchronization, where updates or actions performed by one user are immediately visible to others.
  - The small user avatar icons on the project cards indicate which collaborators are currently active in the workspace.
    
**Independent Service Execution**
  - Each user can run their own service independently within the shared project.
