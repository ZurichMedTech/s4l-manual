# Overview

The **Sim4Life.web** has the following principal views:
* [Landing Page](/docs/overview/landing_page.md), which currently serves primarily for requesting account and user authentication.
* [Dashboard](/docs/overview/dashboard/dashboard.md), which provides an overview of a user's projects, pre-built read-only tutorial projects, and permits the user to create a new project, open a tutorial project, access different services and browse the output files of active pipelines.
* [**Sim4Life**](/docs/overview/sim4life.md), where the user performs all steps in complex multiphysics modeling, from defining the problem in a parametric 3D modeling environment, discretizing, simulating, and analyzing to visualizing the results.
