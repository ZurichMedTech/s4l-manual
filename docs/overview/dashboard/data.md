## Data

```DATA``` tab allows you to browse the output files of all of your active pipelines in one place. This is most useful for downloading the data created on the online platform to your local computer. In this tab, you will find a file tree with ``simcore.s3``. Expanding ``simcore.s3`` will display a folder for each of your projects with the title of that project. Expanding the folder of each project will allow you to access the data (outputs or notebooks) belonging to each Service within that project.

For JupyterLab Services, ``work.zip`` is a zip file containing everything in your directory including notebooks, inputs and outputs while the ``output_1.zip`` contains only the files you have placed inside the ``outputs/output_1`` folder.

### Downloading Data
 - Select the file you would like to download,
 - Click the download button at the very bottom of the window.

### Cloud Storage Types
   To embed your data into Services and Studies, and to store, retrieve and maintain your data, we currently offer Sim-Core S3. This is accessible using the *File Picker* or the *Data* tab in the Dashboard. Files can be selected from there to be used within *Services*. Moreover, files can be added (e.g., from your local disk), deleted, or downloaded from one of the cloud storages to your computer.
