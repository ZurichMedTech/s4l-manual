(1) Dashboard Tabs

  * ```PROJECTS```: Existing projects (own projects, or projects that have been shared by other users) can be accessed and managed, and new projects can be created. Each project is represented by a card.
  * ```TUTORIALS```: A set of pre-built read-only tutorial projects with results is available to all **Sim4Life.web** users. When a tutorial is selected, a copy is automatically created and added to the user’s ```PROJECTS``` tab. This new copy is editable.
  * ```APPS```: Apps are building blocks for projects and can provide data/files, visualize results (2D, 3D), implement code in Jupyter notebooks or perform computations to execute simulations within a project.

    * ```Quick Start```: A short Quick Start guide.
    * ```Guided Tours```: A short Quick Start guide.
    * ```Dashboard Manual```: Technical reference for using the dashboard.
    * ```Sim4Life Manual```: Full documentation for Sim4Life software.
