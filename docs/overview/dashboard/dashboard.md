(1) Dashboard Tabs

  * ```PROJECTS```: Existing projects (own projects, or projects that have been shared by other users) can be accessed and managed, and new projects can be created. Each project is represented by a card.
  * ```TUTORIALS```: A set of pre-built read-only tutorial projects with results is available to all **sim4life.io** users. When a tutorial is selected, a copy is automatically created and added to the user’s ```PROJECTS``` tab. This new copy is editable.
  * ```SERVICES```: Services are building blocks for projects and can provide data/files, visualize results (2D, 3D), implement code in Jupyter notebooks or perform computations to execute simulations within a project.
  * ```DATA```: Allows you to browse the output files of all of your active pipelines in one place. This is most useful for downloading the data created on the online platform to your local computer.

(2) Dashboard Buttons

  * Four buttons (from left to right): (1) shows notifications; (2) allows you to access the *Manual*, *Sim4life Support & Download* page along with *Contact Us* information; (3) redit information which includes *Preferences* and *Billing Center*; (4) drop-down menu (see below) with information about your account.

    * ```Preferences```: Access to Profile, Security, Confirmation, Tag, and Organization settings.

    * ```Quick Start```: A short Quick Start guide. It is also displayed when the **sim4life.io** is accessed for the first time.
    * ```License```: Information about the **sim4life.io** license as well as the licenses of the underlying technologies.
    * ```About```: List of Front-end and Back-end technologies employed by the **sim4life.io**.
    * ```Logout```: To log out from the **sim4life.io**.

(3) Filter and Search

 * This tool allows you to filter *Projects*, *Tutorials* and *Services* (either your own or submitted by others) on respective tabs. You can search and filter by:
    * ```String, Name```
    * ```Keywords```
    * ```Tags```
    * ```Shared with```

(4) Import and Select Projects  

   * ```Import```: Allows the user to import files
   * ```Select Projects```: Allows the user to interactively select projects among project cards 

(5) Starting a New Project

  * To start a session of **sim4life.io**, you can click the ```+ Start Sim4Life``` button to create a new project. This will start the user interface of **Sim4Life**.

(6) Project Card

 * Each card listed here represents a simulation project. It can be created by you, or shared with you by other users. The card contains descriptive information about the project. Click the card to load the project in **sim4life.io**.

(7) Card Options

 * When clicked, the user is provided with additional information about the project and the functionality to edit the description and share the project with other users.
    * ```Open```: Open a particular project.
    * ```Rename```: Changes the name of the project.
    * ```Project data…```: Allows the user to download and store simulation projects including results locally. The simulation file and results are stored in the *workspace* folder.
    * ```Share…```: Opens a window where the user can share the simulation project.
    * ```Tags```: You can add custom tags to your projects to help you classify and filter them.
    * ```Duplicate```: Creates a copy of the simulation project.
    * ```Export cMIS```: This will download various Excel files that you need to adhere to the SPARC Dataset Structure (SDS) and publish your computational project on the SPARC Portal.
    * ```Delete```: Completely deletes the project and related data.
