## Tutorials

A set of several tutorials available in the ```TUTORIALS``` tab of the ```Dashboard``` will help you to get familiar with **Sim4Life**.

Clicking on a tutorial project will create a copy of that project, which will appear in your own ```PROJECTS``` tab with the same name as the tutorial. Any changes you make to this copy will not affect the original tutorial. This is extremely useful, for example, if your team uses the same analysis pipeline but you may want to change an input file.

### Grouping Tutorials

By default, the tutorials will be displayed with a flat list. Alternatively, you can organize them by clicking on the ```Group``` button. For instance, you can group them by ```Tags```. Other grouping options are available, such as ```Shared with``` will group them by ```Organization```.
