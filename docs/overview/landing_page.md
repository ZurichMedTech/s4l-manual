Accessing **Sim4Life.web** requires a valid user account and the registration can be done by clicking ```Request Account```. Once access is granted the user can log in with a valid email address and password combination. Two-factor authentication (2FA) is also available for increased security. An SMS with the required one-time 6-digit PIN is sent to the user's mobile phone number or the code can be requested via email. 

If the user cannot remember the password of an existing account, it can be reset by clicking the ```Forgot Password?``` button and following the instructions there.
