**Sim4Life.web** includes a shop that allows users to rent anatomical models and phantoms for use in simulations within the platform.

**The Shop** includes models from the [IT'IS Foundation Virtual Population](https://itis.swiss/virtual-population/virtual-population/overview/), as well as many [SPEAG Phantoms](https://speag.swiss/products/em-phantoms/overview-2/).

**The Shop** can be found from the dashboard by clicking on the user icon in the top right corner, and then selecting ```The Shop``` from the drop-down menu. 

It can also be found in the top ribbon next to the *Import/Export* button as *Models/Phantoms* within the **Sim4Life** application.
